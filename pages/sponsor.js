            Syntax is a fun — and sometimes funny — podcast for web developers hosted by{' '}
            <a href="https://wesbos.com">Wes Bos</a> and <a href="http://scotttolinski.com/">Scott Tolinkski</a>, two
            independent full stack developers who create online training courses. In each episode, Scott and Wes break
            down topics to provide <em>"Tasty Treats"</em> to the audience — applicable tips and nuggets of information
            to help web developers in their careers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sponsoring the Syntax podcast is ideal for anyone who is looking to reach an engaged, technical, high-income
            audience. This may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developer tooling, software, and services</li>
            <li>Developer teams looking to hire</li>
            <li>Technical training material</li>
            <li>Technical hardware products</li>
            <li>
              Premium lifestyle products targeted towards high-income individuals, such as t-shirts, underwear, or
              backpacks
            </li>
          </ul>

            While exact numbers are hard to get, here are a few nuggets of information about our audience that should
            give you an idea of who is listening:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Syntax has been in the Overcast <strong>top 20</strong> Technology podcasts since launch
            </li>
            <li>
              The geographic makeup of the audience consists of 44% USA, 8% Canada, 8% United Kingdom, 4% Germany, 4%
              Australia, 2% Sweden, 2% Netherlands.
            </li>
            <li>The rest of the audience is fairly well distributed between the rest of Europe, Brazil, and India.</li>
            <li>Of those who listen in the browser, 80% use Chrome, 13% Safari, and 7% Firefox.</li>
            <li>Of those who listen on phones, it's roughly 80% iPhone users and 20% Android users.</li>
            <li>
              According to Twitter's analytic tools, 48% of Wes's U.S. audience has an income of $75,000 or greater.
            </li>
            <li>51% of Wes's followers are aged 18 to 24 and 22% 25 to 34.</li>
            <li>The top computed "lifestyle type" is Online Buyers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Audience Interests</h2>
          <p>
            The Syntax audience is primarily web developers. About half of the shows focus on hard technical skills,
            while the other half focus on soft skills or topics tangentially related to web development.
          </p>

          <p>The audience's technical interests include, but are not limited to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>CSS libraries, frameworks</li>
            <li>JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue</li>
            <li>JavaScript utility libraries</li>
            <li>Server-side JavaScript</li>
            <li>WordPress and Laravel</li>
            <li>Software design patterns and methodologies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On the soft skills side, the audience has an appetite for the following topics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-improvement & productivity</li>
            <li>Freelancing and running small businesses</li>
            <li>Marketing & passive income</li>
            <li>Work/life balance</li>
            <li>Fitness and nutrition</li>
            <li>
              Premium products — Scott and Wes have a weekly "Sick Pick", which is a product or service that they
              have been enjoying lately
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What You'll Get && Pricing</h2>
          <p>We have found that we get the best results for our advertisers when they sponsor at least three shows.</p>
          <p>
            Currently each sponsor spot is $1,000 USD per episode with a minimum of three episodes, though this price will
            increase as our audience does. Single show sponsorships are $1,200. 
          </p>

          <p>As part of the sponsorship package, you'll get:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              A sponsorship section at the top of the episode show notes. These notes will be listed on both the
              Syntax.fm website as well as on each user's mobile device as they listen to the podcast. This is a great
              opportunity to list any coupon codes or unique links you'd like listeners to click on.
            </li>
            <li>
              A mention and single line at the top of the show. For example, Wes might say{' '}
              <em>
                This episode is sponsored by FreshBooks. They are my favourite cloud accounting software, and we will
                talk about why partway through the show.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              A 1-2 min sponsor spot midway during the episode. While we can do a regular ad read, we have found
              that having Scott or Wes talk about the product or service and their experience with it gives it an added
              personal touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              A thank-you tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/syntaxfm">@SyntaxFM</a> with a link to your product or service from the show's
              Twitter account.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Case Study: DevLifts</h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://devlifts.io/">DevLifts</a> is a fitness company that creates personal training and nutrition
            plans for their customers.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of their company launch, DevLifts sponsored Syntax for a single episode, offering a $50 off coupon
            to Syntax listeners.
          </p>

          <p>
            Within 10 days of sponsoring the episode, DevLifts had generated over $9,500 USD in revenue which was
            directly tied to Syntax listeners, resulting in a more than 10× return on their sponsorship investment.
          </p>

          <p>
            DevLifts is now sponsoring multiple episodes and will be using Syntax as an ongoing revenue and leads
            source.
