## Show Notes

1:48 - What the heck is abstraction?

* I like to think of it as sweeping under the rug
* Vue and React devs should be very familiar with the concept

4:44 - When to abstract

* When things are getting too heavy
* Personal preference 
* Some people have an arbitrary line limit

7:25 - When not to abstract

* When savings are minimal 
* When it just adds a pointless layer 

9:40 - Personal code abstractions vs public

* My personal focus is on API simplicity and baked-in smart defaults 
* More specific 
* Public APIs need to be more flexible or at least for some components
