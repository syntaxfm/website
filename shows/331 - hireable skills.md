## Show Notes
04:17 -  Code in general
* Clean, commented, organized
* Take the extra hour before an application and polish it

06:10 - JS
* Basics of the language - storing data in Arrays and Objects
* Looping and flow control
* Array methods
* Promises + async await
* DOM basics - select an element, listen for clicks, update elements
* Node basics
  * Most of your JS basics apply here
  * Read Files, write files
  * Fetch data and return it

08:38 - CSS
* Attention to detail - pixel-perfect replication of designs
* Works well on mobile
* No reliance on libraries - complete reliance on Bootstrap or Tailwind is a red flag. If you use these things, explain clearly why they are useful to you (e.g. augment your skills, not relied on).

12:54 - Real-world libraries
* One of the following: React, Vue, Angular
* Node.js - sending Server data as a response
  * JSON
  * Express, Next.js
* Popular helper libs
  * Date functions / Moment (Moment is old but its still 2x more popular)
  * Lodash
* CSS
  * Scoped CSS
  * Pattern libraries

17:15 - What about data structures and algorithms?
* Yes you obviously need to know about arrays and objects - probably maps and sets too
* Links lists? Tree structures? Traversal?

20:26 - Soft skills
* Know how to talk to PMs and other devs.
* Know how to stay on top of timelines and schedules while communicating.
* You won't last long in any work environment where you aren't able to fit in.
* Many devs sometimes get a big head about doing tech - this is not something you want to emulate. Ignore any kind of internal "us vs them" attitude. It's about the big picture and you'll go further.
* Write good, short, emails that don't sound like you are mad.
