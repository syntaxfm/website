## Show Notes
04:39 - color-contrast()
* Part of CSS5! Maybe.
* The color-contrast() functional notation takes a color value and compares it to a list of other color values, selecting the one with the highest contrast from the list.

06:01 - Accent color

07:34 - currentcolor
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword)

08:54 - Profiled color values - color()
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color())

11:00 - color-mix()
* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix())
* The color-mix() functional notation takes two color values and returns the result of mixing them in a given colorspace by a given amount. 
* Would be handy for programmatically generating colors - 10% more blue for a border? Sure!

14:18 - Space-separated functional color notations
* `rgba(255 255 255 0)` instead of `rgba(255,255,255,0.5)`

15:28 - RGB and HSL with Alpha
* rgb() and hsl() can take alpha and percent values - `rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)` or `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)`

18:22 - Hex + Alpha values
* RRGGBBAA
* How do you remember?!?!
* Transparent

21:49 - lch(), lab(), hwb() notation
* CIELAB color space aka Lab is a color space.
* A color space is an organization of colors in coordination color profiling supported by various physical devices, it supports reproducible representations of color
* Lab is intended as perceptually uniform
* Perceptually uniform - a perceptual uniform color space ensures that the difference between two colors (as perceived by the human eye) is proportional to the Euclidian distance within the given color space.
