## Show Notes
02:50 - What is it?
* Future versions of TypeScript may introduce additional stricter checking under this flag, so upgrades of TypeScript might result in new type errors in your program. When appropriate and possible, a corresponding flag will be added to disable that behavior.

03:26 - `noImplicitAny`
* The `any` type in TypeScript is exactly that - it can be anything.
* TypeScript will try to `infer` the type. When it can't it will be `any`.
* Sometimes you need `any`, but if that is the case, you must explicitly type it as `any`.
* If something is implicitly `any` - it might be a mistake, or you forgot to type it. Risky!

06:01 - `noImplicitThis`
* You must type `this` - it can't be implicitly inferred.

06:47 - `strictFunctionTypes`
* If you have a type that is a function and it doesn't 100%.

07:44 - `alwaysStrict`
* Always turns on strict mode. You can't do things like redeclare `var` variables.

09:25 - `strictNullChecks`
* Makes you check that the item is actually there before accessing a value or method from it.
* Imagine you filter or find on an array, or query selector a DOM element. There is a possibility that nothing is there. `strictNullChecks` makes you check that it's there - like an if statement.
* Optional chaining is super handy here.

11:18 - `strictBindCallApply`

12:38 - `strictPropertyInitialization`

13:37 - `useUnknownInCatchVariables`
