## Show Notes

02:42 - Immutability

05:08 - Records
* Immutable object
* Syntax `#{x: 1, y: 2}`

05:56 - Tuples
* Immutable array
* Syntax `#[1,2,3,4]`

07:18 - For both
* Referred to as a compound primitive
* Can contain only primitives, not objects
* They are compared deeply by their contents rather than their identity

    ```jsx
    assert(#{ a: 1 } === #{ a: 1 });
    assert(#[1, 2] === #[1, 2]);
    assert(#{ a: 1, b: 2 } === #{ b: 2, a: 1 });
    ```

* Potential for optimizations
  * Optimizations for making deep equality checks fast
  * Optimizations for manipulating data structures
* Works well with type systems
* Better integration with the debugger
* Accessed through normal record.scott object like syntax
