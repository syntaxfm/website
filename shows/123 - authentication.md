## Show Notes

4:20 - How should we track users?

* Token based - generally stored in the client
* Session based - stored on the server 
* Token Based (JWT)

6:00 - Token-based auth

* Stateless - the server does not maintain a list of logged in users
* Scalable - you can use serverless functions easily
* Cross domain
* Data can be stored in JWT
* Easy to use on non-web sites like mobile apps
* Hard to expire tokens — you must maintain a list of blacklisted tokens

7:48 - Session-based auth 

* Stateful - generally you maintain a list of session IDs
* Passive - once signed in, no need to send token again
* Easy to destroy sessions

10:48 - How do we identify the user on each request? localStorage or Cookies?

* A common misconception is that localStorage is for tokens while cookies is for sessions
* With localStorage, we need to grab the token and send them along on each request
* With cookies, the data is sent along on each request

11:25 - Security Issues

* XSS for Tokens - make sure bad actors can't run code on your site
* Sanitize inputs
* XSRF - CSRF tokens are needed
