## Show Notes
07:28 - Thoughts
* Apples to oranges, so unfortunately, no super legit ability to compare.
  * SvelteKit isn't analogous with a custom React setup that uses CSR
    * SSR is usually going to be faster - we can ship less JS
    * Some big things changed beyond React → SvelteKit
      * [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) → [GFetch](https://github.com/kiedtl/gfetch)
      * [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) → [Vime](https://vimejs.com/)
    * HLS starts grabbing chunks immediately, so it's hard to get accurate load time and transfer.
* Whole conversion took a couple of months.
* Hardest part was making UI choices and changes, straight-up converting components one by one wasn't actually that tough

16:14 - Converting React components to Svelte
* useState becomes just a straight-up variable
* Graphql calls were hooks now just imported generated functions
* Remove extranous fragments
* Convert {things && } to {#if thing}{/if}
* `<component hello={hello} />` becomes `<component {hello} />`

24:06 - Spark joys
* State
  * Our checkout flow became way more transparent, way easier with Svelte stores
* Render flow
  * Was never something we needed to really think about. Didn't think about memoizing, or worrying about too many renders down the line, just never needed to
* Overall developer experience
  * It's honestly a joy to work in and I don't want to go back
* Making a library
  * Package dir, new SvelteKit project, `svelte-kit package`
  * I made svelte-toy - [https://github.com/leveluptuts/svelte-toy](https://github.com/leveluptuts/svelte-toy)
  * svelte-element-query - [https://github.com/leveluptuts/Svelte-Element-Query](https://github.com/leveluptuts/Svelte-Element-Query)
  * svelte-simple-datatable fork
* Creating a sitemap was extremely easy, because of server-side routes. file.returnformat.ts ie `sitemap.xml.ts`
* CSS without a css-in-js library for scoping is a dream. CSS props are now 100% via CSS variables using the [https://svelte.dev/docs#style_props](https://svelte.dev/docs#style_props)
* Animations are all done with Svelte's internal animations lib

32:45 - Hosting
* adapter-node
* Hosted on [Render](https://render-web.onrender.com/) as a straight-up node process $7/m for more than enough RAM and CPU,
* Lots of other options for static, Vercel, workers whatever, I like having just a straight-up node app you can host anywhere

35:50 - Things to do
* Admin tools
  * [Pancake](https://pancake-charts.surge.sh/) lib for charts

37:00 - Challenges
* ESM is not always smooth sailin
  * Import has from 'lodash/has' didn't working in dev, but import has from 'lodash/has.js' didn't work in prod.
    * Solution was to use lodash.has as the dependency
    * Apollo included all React as a dep unless you import from @core
* TS is great, but there was once where I wanted to define the entire props ts object for a spread prop, but was not possible
* Drag animations

Cloudinary

42:46 - Wes' questions
* What about the ecosystem?
* What about forms + DOM data? 
* Serverless functions?
* Do you always bind to state? Or just access directly?
 
```jsx
formData = writable({
  title: "yo"
})

{$formData.title}

<input bind:value={formData.title} />
```

* Is it stable? 
* [Deno](https://deno.land/) - [Snel](https://crewdevio.mod.land/projects/Snel?ref=madewithsvelte.com)
