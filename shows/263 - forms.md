02:00 - So you made a form:

1. Contact form
2. Sales form
3. Email signup for newsletter
4. Bug report
5. Sign up for an account
6. Password reset

03:00 - Now someone is going to:

1. Have a bot that submits it
2. Maliciously write a bot that submits thousands

04:14 - So what can you do?

4:54 - Honey pot

* This is a field that is either hidden or you tell the user not to fill in
* Can goof up autofill
* Works in many cases

07:37 -  IP Throttle

* Only allow each IP to do an action a certain number or times inside a window
* You may only try signing up once per 10 mins

09:48 Block known ASN

12:37 - Captcha

* Soft captcha: "What is 1 plus 1?"
* Annoying captcha: Type these letters
* Google captcha: Train our self driving cars
