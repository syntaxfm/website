## Show Notes
02:34 - What is semantic HTML?
* What is the content? HTML should describe the content first and foremost.

04:04 - Why semantic HTML?
* Accessibility
* SEO
* Styling is easier
* HTML tags that have meaning:
  * Almost all of them
  * Common ones:
    * `<p>`
    * `<ul>/<ol>` and `<li>`
    * `<a>`
    * `<h1>` to `<h6>`

20:04 - Structural / Layout tags
* `<nav>`
* `<header>`
  * You can have more than one header
  * Header cannot be in a footer / address / header
* `<section>`
* `<footer>`
* `<aside>`
* `<main>`
* `<article>`

26:18 - Some fun ones you might not know
* `<address>`
* `<kbd>`
* `<sup>` / <sub>
* `<datalist>`
* `<time>` and strike?
* `<track>`
* `<wbr>`
* `<cite>`
* `<dfn>`
* `<mark>`
* `<ruby>` / `<rt>` / `<rb>`
  * A ruby annotation is a small extra text, attached to the main text to indicate the pronunciation or meaning of the corresponding characters.
* `<meter>` and `<progress>`
  * While `<progress>` is used to convey how much work in a task has been completed, the <meter> element is used to display a measurement on a known scale. This could be something like the current disk usage on your computer, or a temperature measurement (within a defined range).
* `<marquee>`

32:12 - Visual vs Semantic tags
* Almost all tags in HTML are semantic
* `<i>` vs `<em>` and `<bold>` vs `<strong>`
  * `<i>` and `<bold>` are NOT deprecated like many have said
  * The `<strong>` element is for content that is of greater importance, while the <b> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important.

35:40 - HTML tags with no meaning:
* `<div>`
* `<span>`

37:51 - Some elements have special functionality or styling
* `<details>` and `<summary>` tag
* `<fieldset>` + `<legend>`

40:59 - What elements would we like to see?
* Modal element
  * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)
* Textarea that grows with content
* Animated accordion
* A better table
  * One that works with grid/flex/modern CSS, auto-sizing, max/min widths
* From Twitter:
  * VirtualList
  * Carousel - HOT DRAMA
  * Date range
  * Hero
  * <H> tag that figured its level out by itself. Useful for components that can go anywhere
  * Icon tag
  * Cookie banner
  * <pre> tag that shows HTML elements without encoding
    * You can kinda do this with display block on script and style tags
