## Show Notes

02:12 - Certifications

05:30 - We have standards, and people move faster than standards.
* jQuery moved faster than vanilla JS
* Typescript is sometimes preferred over regular JS
* We have universities that offer web developer certs and many of them are a joke
* The point is that programming is the wild west — it's far too broad and moves far too fast for us to try and fit it in a box

10:28 - Do certifications mean anything?

14:30 - How do you know if you have enough skills (when you're job hunting)?

19:04 - Some jobs do require a certification
* AWS
* Google
