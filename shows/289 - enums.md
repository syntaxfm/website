## Show Notes

03:11 - What are enums?
* A type restricting variables to one value from a predefined set of constants
* Direction = UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT
* Role = ADMIN EDITOR AUTHOR VIEWER
* Day of the Week

05:12 - In GraphQL
* enum Role { ADMIN EDITOR AUTHOR VIEWER}
* Then

07:05 - In TypeScript
* First, declare the type:
  * enum direction = { UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT }
* Then when you defined your function, use that type
  * type User { role: Role } or type User { role: [Role] } 

08:49 - In JavaScript
* Not in JS yet
* There is a proposal in stage 1
  * [https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-enum](https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-enum)
* And a babel plugin:
  * [https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-const-enum](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-const-enum)
* Can use case/switch
* Can use Object or Map keys
