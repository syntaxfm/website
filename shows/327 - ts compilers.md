## Show Notes
03:38 - What is a TypeScript compiler?
* Do we still need [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) / [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/)?

07:49 - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* Transpiler
* It doesn't do typechecking
* New JS features that aren't in TypeScript yet

10:22 - [SWC](https://swc.rs/)
* Rust based compiler
* Doesn't do type checking (yet)
* [https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/571](https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/571)

13:03 - [Deno](https://deno.land/)
* Uses tsc right now
* Might move to Rust
* [https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/5432](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/5432)

13:36 - [Surcase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase)
* [https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase#transforms](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase#transforms)

14:46 - [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
* Compiles, but doesn't do any type checking
* Fastest

17:39 - What about bundlers?
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
* When might you still need a bundler?
  * To handle different types of files that are non-standard
    * Like importing CSS and images
* Treeshaking
* Smaller bundle files
  * Typescript can concatenate to a single file, or all .js files, but smaller / smarter bundles still need a tool for that
* Polyfills
  * Typescript does convert to syntax, but will not polyfill features
  * Something like Promise
    * Syntax can be transpiled to old code
    * Methods like allSettled aren't
