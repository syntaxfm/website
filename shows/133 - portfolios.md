In this Hasty Treat, Scott and Wes talk about portfolios - best practices, organization, and how to use what people are looking for to stand out in the right ways.

## Sentry - Sponsor

If you want to know what's happening with your errors, track them with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Sentry is open-source error tracking that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. Cut your time on error resolution from five hours to five minutes. It works with any language and integrates with dozens of other services. Syntax listeners can get two months for free by visiting [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) and using the coupon code "tastytreat".

## Show Notes

3:21 - Include screenshots (or don't). Often clients can ruin a site after you hand it off.

6:19 - Include list of technologies used

7:25 - Include list of problems solved

7:48 - Use company logos (if allowed)

9:13 - Show mockups on modern laptops/phones

10:04 - Show your work (mockups, sketches, layouts, etc.)

11:39 - Keep it updated

12:10 - You don't need a million examples — max out somewhere around five. People just need a few quick examples of the type of stuff you work on.

14:11 - What about using side projects and tutorials?

16:28 - Dribbble, Github and Instagram are all valid portfolio options as well — often that is the first place people look. Don't ignore these.

* A hot stuff profile on any of these will make you more hireable. Make sure it's creative and looks nice.
