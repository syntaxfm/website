## Show Notes

02:26 - The old Syntax site

* Next.js
* Custom server for
  * API - shows, Latest shows, sick picks
  * On-demand page builds
  * Custom routing

06:41 - The new Syntax site

* Next.js has solved those things now, no need for a custom server. 
  * API Routes
  * On-demand page builds: SSG with Next.js. It's a server, but caches the page builds. Releasing the shows happens with revalidation. It's statically generated like Gatsby, but you can also choose 
  * Custom routing is now done with [pages]
* Very fast to load
* Very fast to build
* Very fast to deploy
* It's now a "dynamic static site"
* Zeit Now 1 to "Vercel"
* Huge thanks to [Tim Neutkens](https://twitter.com/timneutkens) and [Luis Alvarez](https://twitter.com/luis_fades) from Vercel for making it happen.

13:23 - Why not:

* Gatsby
  * Entire site would need to be regenerated exactly at 9am eastern
  * API of the site would need to be done with something else like Netlify Functions - not nearly as nice as Next API routes
* Sapper
