In this Hasty Treat, Scott and Wes talk about React Suspense — what it is, how it works, support and more!

## Sentry - Sponsor

If you want to know what's happening with your errors, track them with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Sentry is open-source error tracking that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time.

3:59 - The problem we have with React right now

  * API calls
  * Image loading
  * Code splitting

7:16 - What is React Suspense?

1. First we convert our async data fetching functions into **resources**
2. Resources can then be read inside render - above the return
3. Resources can be read from cache
4. Resources can be preloaded into a cache if you anticipate needing them
5. Resources reads are blocking for that function - you can't return JSX until the resource is read
6. In your component that fetches data, there is no need to maintain a loading state
7. Then, anywhere higher up in that tree, you can introduce a suspense component
8. The suspense component can **detect** if any of it's children are currently loading data
9. If they are, we can then choose to show a loader via the **fallback** prop
10. We can also choose to **show nothing via the maxDelay prop** — this is helpful for fast connections that shouldn't see the spinner for a short split-second

15:20 - Support

* React.lazy and suspense for code splitting is already here
* The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component
* Loadable Components is recommended if you need splitting with SSR
* Data Resources is not here yet
