## Show Notes

02:25 - Relaxed fit development

* Not concerned with it being perfect
* Will act as a loose digital garden, so it needs to be flexible
* Keep my talks and podcast appearances somewhere 

04:40 - The stack

* Svelte / Sapper
* CSS variables 
* Static generation with markdown
* No API 
* Hosted on Netlify

08:15 - Why?

* I dropped that db life in 2015 and never looked back
* I'm a developer - markdown is good for me
* I like a playground for ideas, so the new site throws out any idea of formality and dives into being a playground for myself.
* Full page animations. Orchestration. Fully SSG.
* Code is painless to add to â€” adding a blog post is as easy as creating a markdown file
