## Show Notes
05:20 - Astro
* What it is:
  * [astro.build](http://astro.build) is a next gen "meta" framework that eases some of React's pain but also is not just React.
  * [https://twitter.com/georges_gomes/status/1380801812656226304](https://twitter.com/georges_gomes/status/1380801812656226304)
* Why we're excited about it:
  * Server Side JS frameworks, combine Svelte, React, Vue as needed in one component that is an SFC using markdown style meta data.
  * Scoped CSS by default (a la Svelte). Sass out of the box.
  * Collections import for .md files

```html
// pages/blog.astro
---
import PostPreview from '../components/PostPreview.astro';

const blogPosts = import.meta.collections('./post/*.md');
---

<main>
  <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
  {blogPosts.map((post) => (
    <PostPreview post={post} />
  )}
</main>
```

12:06 - ViteKit
* What it is:
  * Framework-agnostic
  * API routes
  * Pages (frontend, optional hydration)
  * Adapter for Node, static, Vercel, cf worker, etc. Inspired by SvelteKit.

  * [https://kit.svelte.dev/docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs)

19:07 - Remix.run
* What it is:
  * [Remix.run](https://remix.run/)
