## Show Notes

 2:52 - What is a CSS framework?

* Pre-written CSS that takes over the basic styling of your app
* Can include just utilities or lots of styles (minimal to overboard)
* Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation were the pioneers
* Follow different CSS styles from "functional CSS" to utility-first to BEM

7:33 - Functional (aka Utility) based

* Tachyons
* Tailwind

9:59 - Preprocessor based

* Bootstrap

11:33 - Styled Components based

* Rebass
* Styled Systems
* Facepaint

15:50 - Why use one?

* Makes styling FAST
* Makes hard things easy
* Some, like Bootstrap, have themes
* Keeps your own CSS minimal and organized
* Built on an established system
* Lots of people use the same CSS

19:22 - Why not use one?

* CSS class hell
* Stops you from learning how CSS works
* Size (not all have this problem)
* Brotli, Purify CSS
* You will be overriding a ton of it
* You like exclusively writing the code you need and nothing else
