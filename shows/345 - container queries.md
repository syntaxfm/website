07:22 -  Why?
* Container queries are media queries for components (e.g. they are based on the element's size, not the browser).
* This is in line with how we write components.
* It will change the way we write CSS.

08:49 - The Syntax
* Containers need to be defined as containers via containment context

```css
.container {
  contain: size layout;
}
```

New contain value:

```css
.inline-container {
  contain: inline-size;
}
```

This is the same as the logical properties. Assuming you read LTR, or RTL:
* size - width and height
* inline-size = width
* block-size = height

```css
/* @container <container-query-list> { <stylesheet> } */
@container (inline-size > 45em) {
  .media-object {
    grid-template: "img content" auto / auto 1fr;
  }
}
```
