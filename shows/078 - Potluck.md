## Show Notes

3:33 - Would you ever consider doing a live Syntax show?

* Yes! Get tickets at [JAMstack_conf](https://jamstackconf.com/)

4:31 - What are your thoughts on Flutter? Does React Native have some solid competition now?

* Google's answer to React Native.
* [Flutter](https://flutter.io/)
* [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)

9:43 - What are your website security essentials for static and dynamic sites? What's the deal with forms? Is it bad to put a form on my site with no server-side validation?

* Not cool. Always do server-side validation.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

14:55 - Do you have a 'go-to' stack when building new web apps? If so, what is it and how would you go about choosing the right stack for the project?

* Scott - Gatsby for sites / Meteor Apollo, React, MongoDB for db needing accounts sites
* Wes - Next.js, Express Backend + either MongoDB, DiskDB or Prisma (or hasura)

21:51 - What are your thoughts on 100 Days of Code Challenge?

* Consistency and accountability.
* The best way to get good.
* [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

25:05 - I really have been learning a lot of React recently and have been wondering what is the difference between Next.js, Gatsby.js and vanilla React?

* Dynamic vs static. What are your needs, how often does the content change.
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  * Use for dynamic needs
  * It can do static exports too
  * Convert to markdown 
  * Nothing special other than Routing and SSR (Server request getInitialProps)

* [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
  * Use for static needs
  * Gatsby has lots of adapters

30:38 - What are websockets and when should they be used?

* A request that is always open - it responds to events instead of pinging, pushing or pulling data

35:15 - I would love to hear your take on PWAs. Do either of you have any experience with building or using them?

* [Syntax Ep 50 - Progressive Web Apps](https://syntax.fm/show/050/progressive-web-apps)

40:16 - I'm a nervous newbie who's concerned about doing a web app that accepts payments or sensitive information. How can I know I've done everything to create a secure website and also protect myself from being sued by the client if their website gets hacked? I'm trying to be a jam stack developer so I'm looking at things like [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

* Don’t save sensitive info in plain text. Use services that make it tough to do that until you are confident.
* Look up PIPEDIA

43:23 - What is a JavaScript generator? I heard that async/await creates a “generator” under the hood.

* Pausable function that can return multiple values - call .next() on it

46:54 - Are web components worth it in 2018?

* [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/)
* Polymer
* Svelte

49:52 - How soon the designers replace React Developers with the invent of tools like Framer X?

* Not soon.
* Your job is changing and will continually change
* [SouthPark - They Took Our Jobs!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEiWU1MbBfk)

56:52 - Have you, or anyone you know ever thought of quitting the industry because of difficulties you have run into?
