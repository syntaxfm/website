## Show Notes

7:58 - Personal Branding

* Build trust and reciprocity
* Be authentic to yourself and let that carry through in your work.
* Have the guts to put yourself out there and establish yourself as an expert.
  * Speak at conferences
  * Write blog posts
  * Make YouTube videos
  * Be on podcasts
  * Start your own podcast

14:50 - Running a Business

* Treat people well.
* Reward your customers.
* Don't punish your users.
* Have a refund policy.

19:26 - Social Media

* Don't push people off a platform. Bring content to them that is tailored for that platform.
* Get in early, before the platform becomes super crowded.

* YouTube
  * Quality content through quantity.
  * Write good SEO titles.
  * Tease your paid content or create a free one-off.
  * Don't expect to make a lot of money, but it can be great for growing a brand.

* Twitter
  * Be helpful - small, digestible tips and tricks and great for growing a Twitter following.
  * Quality is still the key.
  * [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) is a great example of consistent, high quality content.

* Facebook
  * People have other interests besides web development. People like to see into your life.
  * Use Facebook to give people a window into who you are.

* Reddit
  * Reddit is really difficult. It's easy to get banned. The best strategy is to not focus on marketing and just try to be helpful.
  * It's sort of replaced forums and is a great place to build communities around different hobbies.

* Instagram
  * Recently IG has been blowing up for web developers.
  * [Dhanish](https://www.instagram.com/dhanishgajjar/) is a perfect example of how to do Instagram well.

49:55 - Paid Advertising

* Don't be sleazy.
* Ads are good for getting likes and driving some traffic to something, but it takes experimentation to get the best bang for you buck.

54:40 - Email marketing

* Wes: Email is probably responsible for most of my sales.
* Keeps people up to date and helpful for promoting new courses.
* Helpful for figuring out what people want.

59:17 - Partnerships

* A lot of companies want to partner rather than just sponsor.
* It can be a great way to fund the creation of products/courses.
* Affiliate programs are great when they work out.

67:30 - Freebies

* Giving away free content is a surefire way to get people to pay attention.
* It's about giving back to the community as much as marketing your products.
