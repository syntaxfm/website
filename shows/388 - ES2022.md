## Show Notes
04:50 - Regex indicies
* New `d` flag in a regex
* [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/)
* This will tell you the indexes (indicies) of the regex matches
* Handy if you need to highlight or replaces matches in a string
* We can ask for the start and end positions of each matched capture group

07:16 - Class updates
* Private fields
* Properties and Methods to be kept private 
* Prefix them with a `#` 
* =Helpful for internal state and methods which should not be accessed directly or at all by external 
* In React how we have ___INTERNTAL_NEVER USE THIS_

```jsx

class ColorButton extends HTMLElement {
  // All fields are public by default
  color = "red"

  // Private fields start with a #, can only be changed from inside the class
  #clicked = false
}

const button = new ColorButton()
// Public fields can be accessed and changed by anyone
button.color = "blue"

// SyntaxError here 
console.log(button.#clicked) // Cannot be read from outside
button.#clicked = true // Cannot be assigned a value from outside
```

* Getters and setters introduced in es5
* [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_accessors.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_accessors.asp)

```jsx
class Person {
  #hobbies = ['computers']
  get #hobbiesGetter() { return this.#hobbies }
	#getHobbies() { return this.#hobbies }
	getHobbiesPublic() { return this.#hobbies }
}

const scott = new Person();

scott.#getHobbies(); // doesn't work
scott.getHobbiesPublic(); // works
```

09:07 - Class fields
* This may seem super old because we have been polyfilling it forever
* Right now if you want an instance field on a class, you need to declare it in the constructor
* Now we can just declare them inside the class

10:36 - Static fields and methods
* As above can also be **static with the static keyboard**
* Works for methods too
  * Explain what a static method is

13:17 - Top level await
* So handy in modules. Need to pull in some data? Simple. 

15:19 - Ergonomic brand checks for private fields
* Used for checking if a private field on a class exists using the `in` keyword

16:00 - `.at()` method
* Strings and arrays - we can use square brackets to reference items of the array
* Super handy for grabbing the last item of an array

```jsx
// ðŸ”¥ New .at() method on arrays and strings

const toppings = ['pepperoni', 'cheese', 'mushrooms'];

// The old way to grab the last item
toppings[toppings.length - 1]; // mushrooms

// using .at() method with a negative index
toppings.at(-1); // mushrooms 
// works with any index
toppings.at(0); // pepperoni
toppings.at(-2); // cheese

// and with strings!
'Meeting Room: B'.at(-1) // B
```

* Why not use array[-1]? 
* We used to use slice(-1)
* What about indexOf?

21:34 - Handy `hasOwn` method
* [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-accessible-object-hasownproperty](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-accessible-object-hasownproperty)

24:51 - Class static block
* A static block allows you to run code before creating an optional static property during initialization
