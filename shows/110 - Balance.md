## Show Notes

8:06 - Know when you work best

* The 9-5 isn't for everyone - you know when you work best, so use that to your advantage

9:39 - Work when it's time to work, life when it's time to life

* Don't do laundry during work time

11:08 - Make it clear to family members when you are working

* Wishy-washy in-between can cause tension - are you working? Can I interrupt you?
* Working after hours
* Text if you need me

14:34 - Have a defined space for work

* If I bring my laptop downstairs, I don't bring a charger
* Clean yo nasty desk space
* It's a mental shift when you sit down - "okay now I am working"

21:14 - Know how to "zone it"

* Headphones
    * Music or podcasts
* Block all distractions
* Close email
* Pay attention to what gets you there, when it stops working, change it up

24:46 - Keep hobbies

* Away from screens
* Physical or relaxing or both

26:37 - Exercise

* Good for mind and body
* Huge gains long term and short term 

27:31 - Prioritize your to-do list

* One reason many people over-work is that they feel they have too much to do
* Add items to your to-do list when they pop into your head - out of your head, into your system

31:28 - Walk away from difficult problems

* Your brain will chew on problems as time goes on and help you solve them
* Literally take a walk outside

34:04 - Meetups, conferences or tutorials

* Reinvigorate your hunger for coding and make you happier both at home and work
* Easy to get burned out from working too much (or not paying enough attention to your work)
