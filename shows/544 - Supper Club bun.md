In this supper club episode of Syntax, Wes and Scott talk with Jared Sumner about why and how he created Bun, what Zig is, and the future of Bun.

## Tuple - Sponsor

This week’s sponsor is [Tuple](https://tuple.app/syntax), an app built specifically for remote pair programming. The app is written in C++ and tuned for high-resolution screen sharing and low-latency remote control. Because developers deserve better than Zoom or Meet for pairing.
