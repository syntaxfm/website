## Show Notes
04:06 - Rural internet is huge for:
* Access to information
* Remote work
  * Opens up job opportunities for many residents who can't relocate due to family
* Home values
  * Big city folk moving into rural areas and driving prices up is another issue alltogether
* Smart rural home

05:46 - Previous setup
* We have a cottage
* LTE Routers
* Yagi Antennas
* Worked well, but slow
* $4/gig over 100gb
* Grey market - one went up/down
* Alternatives
  * WISP - no access
  * XPLORNET @ (hughesnet) - BRUTAL
  * Bell LTE - $$$ - slow

08:35 - The signup, install, price
* $129 CAD Deposit ($100 USD)
* $650 for the dish
* $120/month
* Unlimited bandwidth
* Needs a clear view of the northern sky
* Clear from obstructions is key
* Every 1 foot up is 2 foot of obstructions cleared
* I put it on a 25ft piece of wood
* Bought a pipe adaptor from Starlink

09:59 - The performance
* These numbers are not impressive to anyone with fiber, but are LIFE CHANGING to rural folks
* From 30mbps - 200mbps down - some users posted ~350 down
* Upload from 25mpbs - 80mbps (better than you can pay for where I live in the city)
* Ping is around 40ms
* Downtime is measured in seconds
* Youtube streams super smoothly
* Zoom works great
* Facebook + Instagram issues
  * Many reported changing DNS fixed it

14:21 - The equipment
* Starlink comes with a router
  * Does not support bridge mode
  * Doesn't have WPS
  * Only one hard-wired port
  * POE-only
* UniFi Dream Machine
* Three access points
* POE switch for Starlink Router
  * Gives you stats
* The ethernet is hard-wired into the dish, so you have to drill a huge hole in the house
