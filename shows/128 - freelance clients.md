## Show Notes

1:27 - Question from Andreas Trattner: I am a backend developer with 4+ years experience working on large systems in Europe and am considering moving toward freelancing/contracting. However, I find it difficult to discover quality opportunities. Any tips you can share on how to strategically get projects?

* There isn't a secret trove of work, and there's no one way to do it.

4:50 - Relationships

* Trust and relationships rule all. The best paying gigs are never advertised. 
* Who should you know?
  * Other developers
    * **How?** Meetups, Conferences, Twitter, Slack rooms, Friends
    * Tip: Volunteering is a great way to get in to conferences, plus you often get to know people
    * Tip: If you are friends of a friend who gets a lot of work, as for a introduction
  * Designers and marketers
    * You usually work together
    * **How?** Twitter, Email, Dribbble, Instagram
  * Project managers
    * **How?** Cold emails, tweets
  * Office managers
    * Life blood of the office - they know everyone
    * Often move into other roles
    * **How?** Meetups, previous employees
  * Entrepreneurs
    * Lots of connections, often switching gears
    * **How?** Demo camps, Facebook marketing groups
  * Venture capitalists
    * Have dozens of companies and tons of connections
    * **How?** Demo camps, introductions, cold email

19:08 - Display of expertise

* It certainly is an option to just be really freaking good at what you do
* Speaking at conferences and local meetups
* Working on open source
  * Helping in chat rooms
  * Posting guides
  * Maintaining docs
* Offering reviews / Make things public
  * Performance - [Harry Roberts from CSS Wizardry](https://csswizardry.com/)
  * Accessibility  - [HeydonWorks](http://www.heydonworks.com/)
  * WordPress speed
  * React checking
* Start a podcast
* Blogging
* Volunteering

9:22 - Visibility

* You need to let everyone know what you do. Your mom's uncle's friend's cousin on Facebook might casually ask for recommendations.
* Instagram / Photos. Showing people what you are doing and what you are working on will make a mental note in their head that you do that type of work.
* Facebook / Twitter / Instagram
* Blogging
  * This makes the "vetting" process much easier
* Tweeting
* YouTube videos
* Slack channels you are involved in

38:02 - Other tactics

* SEO - Locality (Toronto designer), specific technologies (Redux contractor)
* Craigslist
  * This one sucks, but it can lead to decent work occasionally
  * You need to be more vigilant in screening, most clients will suck
* Cold asks - Just ask people what works well
  * "Hey, I'm looking to book a few contracts starting June 2019. I love working with ______ and you can see my work here"
* Put a phone number on your website. Seriously.
* UpWork
  * Won't make as much money here because of competition
* Local business listings
  * Find online and offline biz listings
  * Old fashioned — putting your card on bulletin boards

47:29 - Maintaining Relationships

* Check in every few months with non-biz related contact
  * But also just straight up ask for work
* Christmas / Thank-you gifts
