6:18 - General Design Tips

* Spacing is important
* Using patterns and textures

* Use subtle gradients
  * [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/gradient)

* Use subtle drop shadows
  * Multiple shadows on one element can have a nice effect

* Don't use true black and white (e.g. #000 or #fff) - use softer variation of black and white
  * Use CSS Variables for custom blacks and whites
  * CSS default colors are almost always too harsh

* Default browser UI is almost never the best UI
  * Select elements, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. can all be styled - it's no fun, but way better than it’s ever been

40:22 - UX Design & Animation

* Don't use animations when not necessary
* Subtle scale/transitions on hover can be a nice effect
* [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)
* [Patagonia's Bears Ears](http://bearsears.patagonia.com/)

* CSS transitions vs Physics based

51:30 - How To Get Better

* Follow UI-themed Instagram accounts
* [siteInspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/)
* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
* [UISources](https://www.uisources.com/)
* [Follow Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/i/moments/994601867987619840)

* Find a free mockup and build it out pixel for pixel

* Take time to challenge what you think is possible or doable technically and creatively
