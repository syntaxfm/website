## Show Notes

5:40 - Banners and popups 

* Interfere 
* Static
* Dismissible
* Cookie/localstorage
* When that popup is updated, it should show again. Maybe use a hash of the content? Or length? Something that resets itself every time the content is updated.
* [Private client-side-only PWAs are hard](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22686602)

14:35 - Good styling

* What happens if they add an image?
* Do they have access to the branded fonts and colors in their WYSIWYG?
* Can you revoke 100px red Times New Roman?

18:32 - Page alerts

* Yellow, green, red
* Alerts on existing pages

21:08 - New pages

* Is there a good template for new pages?
* Can they easily set the slug?
  * [whatever.com/covid19](http://whatever.com/covid19)
* Can they add it to the nav?

23:52 - Google's "Hours of Operation"

* Is that easy to change?
* Meta tags: [https://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification](https://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification)

25:43 - Other 

* Own your audience!
* Email newsletter ready to rock
* Online pickup? Basic scheduling software
  * [https://www.cityhive.net/](https://www.cityhive.net/)
  * [https://snipcart.com/](https://snipcart.com/)

34:38 - Deployment
