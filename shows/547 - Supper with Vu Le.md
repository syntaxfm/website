In this supper club episode of Syntax, Wes and Scott talk with Vu Le about his path to working at Disney. How did he learn to code? How do you get a job at Disney? What's the tech stack inside a Disney team?

## Tuple - Sponsor

This week’s sponsor is [Tuple](https://tuple.app/syntax), an app built specifically for remote pair programming. The app is written in C++ and tuned for high-resolution screen sharing and low-latency remote control. Because developers deserve better than Zoom or Meet for pairing.
