## Show Notes
04:08 - Is there a mechanism for exporting a React/Vue/Svelte component as a web component?

11:42 - You guys chat a lot about your sweet gear and desk setups. As a newcomer to web development it's all a little expensive for me to mimic what you have; at least before I've learned enough to justify investing in better equipment. My question is: what are the minimum specs (laptop/monitor/etc) you would recommend a beginner just starting out in webdev?

22:35 - I rarely, if ever, hear you guys or any other web dev related podcast mentioned Python, Flask, Django etc. Do you have any experience with those frameworks and can you give any thoughts you may have on Python as a language for back end development.

26:47 - What do you think of using Docker containers to do development work? I have seen a couple articles talking about it, but it doesn't seem super common to use since few GitHub projects have Dockerfiles in their repos. 

32:19 - I've often heard you two talk about the idea of the "golden handcuffs", where a job pays well, but the employees are miserable. I think I might be in that situation right now. I've tried organizing my day so my time is better segmented. I can't tell if this is the natural progression of a developer advancing in their career and I just need to adjust better, or if I need to make a change. Any advice or tips you have to better manage time or decide what's next would be much appreciated.

37:28 - When it comes to desktop browser testing, is there a difference anymore is browser rendering engines? Do most (if not all) browsers use Google's rendering engine?

39:20 - As someone who got into the industry relatively recently (around 2019), component frameworks and single-page applications were my introduction to web development. I am now really interested in learning more about the "traditional" way of doing things, 100% server-rendered. What's my recourse here? Ruby on Rails, Laravel, something else? Is there an agreed upon "modern" way to do a server-rendered monolithic app?

43:43 - I wish to ask the kind of plug-in, extensions or stand-alone software you use for code prediction and to help you code faster. I personally use Kite and VS Code's intellisense, it seems to get it wrong more times than right. Do both of you have any recommendation?

47:18 - Is there any benefit to using prop types in TypeScript for React projects?

48:14 - I'm currently planning to build an audio-focused app (maybe even more than one actually), and I've been wondering how you would solve the problem of storing and fetching (on-demand) hundreds, perhaps thousands, of little audio-files. I've got some deep reservations against AWS, although I'm somewhat familiar with it - the complexity, hidden (and hard to estimate) costs etc. I'm thinking about Digital Ocean or something like that. Would it be too hard to implement things like caching and such yourself. Any thoughts?
