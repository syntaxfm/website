## Xojo — Sponsor

Xojo is a cross-platform development tool for creating native apps for desktop, mobile, web and Raspberry Pi.

With Xojo you really can write just one version of your app, say, on the Mac, click a button, and have a completely native Windows version too.

Xojo lets you abstract yourself from specific platform details, so you can focus on what makes your app unique. All apps have completely native controls, even if they weren’t developed on that platform. Just use drag and drop to create your user interface, and one language to program the functionality.

Users also include Fortune 500 companies, citizen developers, professional developers, IT, hobbyists and students - anyone who wants to build apps faster.
