```
// Finds all p tags that have an anchor tag as a child
p:has(a) {}
// Can find children of parent as well
// Finds the button of a paragraph that contains an a tag 
p:has(a) button {}
// Finds all p tags that don't have an anchor tag as a child
p:not(:has(a)) {}
// Finds all p tags where a is a direct sibling
p:has(> a) {}
// would find <p><a>Hi</a></p>
// would not find <p><span><a>hi</a></span></p>

In the past we would write

```
header p:hover,
main p:hover,
footer p:hover {
  color: red;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

:where is essentially a short had for making this easier considering the 2nd half of these selectors is the same. Will make your css dryer

```
:where(header, main, footer) p:hover {}
```

Also super handy in avoiding css blocks being ignored for unsupported features.

```
// Doesn't work
div:has(p), div:some_new_selector(p)

// Will still work for :has if has is supported
:where(div:has(p), div:some_new_selector(p))
```
