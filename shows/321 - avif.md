03:10 - What is AVIF?
* AVIF is derived from the keyframes of an AV1 video
* Royalty free (big deal)
* What about [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)?
* Basically half the file size of a WebP for free, which was already about half the size of a jpeg
* It's a lossy format — ie it inherently will degrade the image
