## Show Notes
03:24 - Synchronous / Async

05:23 - Multi-threaded
* JavaScript has a single "main thread"
* But you can have more threads with web workers

08:12 - Blocking
* JavaScript can stop other things on the page from running
* A script tag can block HTML from being parsed
* Most stuff in JavaScript is non-blocking
* Node.js write to filesystem can be blocking

10:27 - Concurrent + Parallel
* JavaScript start/stop are concurrent
* The API runs on a different thread
* Doesn't REALLY matter

13:22 - Consecutive / Waterfall
* One after another

13:48 - Callback
* A function to run when this thing *happens* or *is done*
* Click event callback
* Websocket on data callback
  * Like a tweet stream
* Data fetch callback
  * Almost entirely replaced with  async + await

17:56 - Script Tag Async + Defer
* Doesn't block other content
* Runs when ready - doesn't care about DOMcontentLoaded
* Wait until the page is loaded before running
* If the script tag is above content, don't wait for it
* Good for things that aren't called on page load

21:54 - Lazy
* Load it in later - maybe when it's scrolled into view, or as needed
* Not mission-critical
