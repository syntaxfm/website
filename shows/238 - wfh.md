## Show Notes

2:39 - Your space

* You need a table
  * Card table or dining room table
* Keyboard + monitor
* Don't work from your bed or couch
* Headphones can get you in the zone (noise-canceling ftw)

16:36 - Routine

* Shower, shave, makeup
* Clear start and stop times - even if that means it's 5am to 11am because you are splitting
* Taking breaks is important

25:24 - Focus

* TODO list - write a list of what you hope to do at the start of the day, check things off, feel good about yourself
* Eat That Frog - for the 100th time
* Don't watch or check the news during work hours
* Block the terms related to the pandemic or politics on social media - you don't need that info there
  * DOOM Scrolling

30:11 - Self care

* Video games or relaxing things post work
* Exercise
  * Kettlebells, spin bike, bodyweight workouts
    * Stronger by Science has a great episode about this - [https://www.strongerbyscience.com/podcast-episode-38/](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/podcast-episode-38/)
* Zoom Happy Hours
* Don't overly rely on substances to get you through
* Get your VD (vitamin D)
* Don't stress out yourself at night - don't look up news before bed

43:20 - Managing kids and sharing time with your partner

* First of all, props to you all - this is really hard, mentally and physically
* This will vary greatly depending on your SO's job, number and age of kids
* Our SOs have work and jobs of their own
* Watching young kids is hard work
* Give each other 30 min brakes
* Kids need routine - put something in place
* Some times Uncle Mickey needs to take over, and that's ok
* Communication is key
* Schedule Examples:
  * 6-12 and 12-6
  * 4 hours each
  * 2 hour trade off
  * Focus time (calls, deep work) and half-focus time (emails, etc.)
* Have empathy with everyone: co-workers, SO, kids
* Check in on your peeps
* Keep an eye on your co-workers, even the extroverted ones
