## Show Notes
04:55 - Components
* Strategies
* Example:

  ```tsx
  type Props = {
      value: string;
  }

  const App = (props: Props) => <div />
  ```
   
* Return type? JSX.Element
* FC or FunctionComponent
* It's discouraged for this reason: `It means that all components accept children, even if they're not supposed to`
* It could be useful for a return type

12:13 - Props
* Default props:
  ```jsx
  const defaultJoke: JokeProps = {
      joke: 'LOL JOE',
      id: 'YEAH',
      status: 200,
  };
  
  function JokeItem({ joke = defaultJoke }: JokeProps): JSX.Element {
      return (
      <li>
          {joke.joke} = {joke.id}
      </li>
      );
  }
  ```
* Because props are always destructured, you often have to make a new type for your props. You can't just type each argument by itself.

18:38 - State
* Just like Generics, State can be inferred
* If your type is simple and you're using useState, it just works:
`const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);`

22:27 - useEffect
* Nothing special required
* Good use of void: If you want to use a Promise function but not worry about await or .then(), you can pop a void in front of it:
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
console.log('Mounted');
// getJoke().then(console.log).catch(console.error);
void getJoke();
}, [getJoke]);
```

26:09 - Refs
* Very similar to state however some interesting things with null:
`const ref1 = useRef<HTMLElement>(null!);`
* "Instantiating the ref with a current value of null but lying to TypeScript that it's not null."

29:33 - Custom Hooks
* This is a great use case for Tuples

31:00 - Context
* This is probably the most complex thing in this list
* First define the types
* Use generic to pass in types OR null
* This can also be non-null if you have default values in createContext:
`const AppCtx = React.createContext<AppContextInterface | null>(null);`

35:21 - Events
* The React events system is better than Vanilla JS
* Can handle them inline and have it inferred: `onClick={e ⇒ yeah(e.target)}`
```jsx
const onSetType = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) =>
    setType(e.target.value)
```
* React has a bunch of events built in — many of them take a Generic argument so you can specify the type of element that triggered it. Handy for native API methods like play and pause.

39:27 - ForwardRef
* Again use of <> to pass in forwarded ref type as param 1, Props types as param 2:
```jsx
type Props = { children: React.ReactNode; type: "submit" | "button" };
export type Ref = HTMLButtonElement;
export const FancyButton = React.forwardRef<Ref, Props>((props, ref) => (
  <button ref={ref} className="MyClassName" type={props.type}>
    {props.children}
  </button>
));
```

41:30 - ESLint
* Typescript-react is good
* Extend your own
* Most JS rules apply to TS

46:20 - React as Global React 17

- Also add JSX: True to eslint globals for typing things like JSX.Element
- global.d.ts

```jsx
import * as react from "react"
import * as react_dom from "react-dom"

declare global {
    type React = typeof react
    type ReactDOM = typeof react_dom
}
```

48:08 - TSConfig
* `jsx: "react"`
* React emit .js files with JSX changed
* Preserve .jsx file output
* React-native → .js files with jsx not changed

53:05 - Frameworks?
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) makes this a TREAT
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) just use .tsx extensions
  * [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-ts-config/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-ts-config/)
