## Show Notes
03:41 - What do you miss about NOT being self-employed? What are some UNEXPECTED perks of being self-employed?

05:47 - Hypothetically, what would a LinkedIn recruiter need to say to pull you away from your current development work, and possibly even the podcast?

09:08 - What percentage of your time do you guys spend doing work for clients vs your own courses/projects?

10:04 - Do you still do most of your work yourself, or do you outsource some parts of it? (work can be anything related to your business, not just making the courses)

12:48 - Could you all talk about protected/private routes in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)? I’m coming from [create react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) type routing.

16:07 - What would be doing for a living if not a developer?

17:50 - What do you think about [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/)? Are you guys planning to talk over there some time?

24:18 - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/)? Which do you think will be the top? And should developers learn both?
