## Show Notes

3:20 - Depression

* Honestly just explaining depression would be great. Too many times I’ve heard “but you don’t look sad”
* As someone who struggles with depression, what are some things I can do to rekindle and things I enjoy like developing and hobbies? This would greatly benefit me for learning more dev related things outside of doing it for work.
* My depression is due to some other cause in personal life - two years into it.
* Coding has bought me little life back as this is only thing I have to do.
* What can we do from an outsider's view to someone who might have depression? 

12:23 - Anxiety

* Imposter Syndrome x 1000
* How to deal with increased anxiety during these times?
* How to avoid anxiety and feel useless when working products that you don't appeal to you?
* Wanted to ask the Dr about why do I feel that I have to work on 1000 projects that seem to never finish? 😣This is inducing a lot of anxiety sometimes.
* I am on depression medication. Sometimes, I feel scared that I am so slow and don't feel accomplished enough like people working at FANG, etc, being a SE.
* How to deal with the anxiety caused by today’s events around the world and the need to isolate yourself from society even though we crave human interaction?

29:12 - Focus and job performance

* How to keep motivation and focus? I find myself enjoying work but having a hard time focusing on it. All the "distraction-free" apps don't work because I can turn them off and I feel they literally have no power over me.
* Hardcore mode
* Pomodoro technique

35:10 - Motivation and remote work

* Bore-out
* Burnout
* How do you deal with loss of focus and happiness in web development (especially on remote jobs)?
* Working for yourself at home, you don't get a chance to bounce ideas and encouragement from others in an office. What're some good ways to compensate for that to ensure you maintain a positive mindset?
* Work on new things
* Find ways to try new things

40:38 - Stress

* Correctly identifying source of (negative?) stress. Not lashing out when under stress.
* How to avoid eating to cope with stress?
