## Show Notes
01:58 - T-Shirts 101
* T-Shirts are cool
* I sold 100 right away to get the kinks out
* Then I did pre-order
* The stack
  * [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

09:08 - Selling: Front-end
* [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/)
* It's a button
* When Someone buys, they scrape the site for the HTML
  * If you only have a client-side rendered button, you use the JSON API instead
* Integrated into [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) pretty easily
* Wrote one custom hook to count inventory and disable when sold out
* I thought Snipcart would be enough, but I soon realized it wasn't. I needed something to fulfill the shipment.

10:10 - Selling: Shipping Quotes
* Snipcart has integration for USPS, etc.
* You can also do custom shippers
* It's a webhook
* They also take care of customs declaration

13:30 - Selling: Backend
* Next.js Dashboard
  * Integrate with [ChitChats](https://chitchats.com/en), [Stallion Express](https://stallionexpress.ca/), and SnipCart.
* The tech
* Shipping Labels
  * Packing slip

18:05 - Fulfilling
* Printing labels
  * Designed with CSS + React
  * Print CSS is wild
  * Fan Fold labels were way better
  * I switched to Stallion Express
  * Cheaper
* Printing packing slips
* Batch scanning
* Scanning → Mark as shipped
  * Started with webcam
  * Bought scanner for cheap
  * QR code was better because my tokens were long
  * Data matrix is often better
* Sending notifications
  * Hit the endpoint via Snipcart

28:48 - The physical part
* T-Shirts printed from local supplier
  * U-Haul to get them here
* Bags printed in China (about 40 cents each)
* I wrote a bunch of code to organize by size
  * This cut down on moving around (14 hours if you save 30 seconds per shirt)
* Some got stickers
* Multiples were the hardest
  * 24 different types of shirts
    * some wanted 4xl
    * some wanted tall

36:30 - Common questions
* Why did you do this yourself?
  * Fun project
  * I learned a ton
  * This is how you don't burn out
* Why not print-on-demand? (DTG)
  * Tonal
  * Embroidery
  * Quality
  * Money
    * Pay people in my community
* Control
  * Bags, stickers, etc..
  * [stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/)
* Why not $companyThatHandlesIt
  * I want to do stickers
  * I want to do decks
* Why not [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)
  * Large orders still need major fulfillment strategies
  * Code has to be written or money spent

44:16 - Other lessons learned
* Queues would be good here
  * Sometimes you had to wait 3+ seconds for the confirmation of shipping
* No one reads, it was pre-order
* Don't buy shipping right away — people email about incorrect addresses
* Over-order by a few each (out of 1550 orders, five got partial refunds and three got full refunds)
* Pre-order is great because you can offer many sizes
* Async JS to do things at most 50 at a time
