06:02 - Why nest?
* Easier to read
* Easier to write
* Prevents refactoring errors, allows for dry-er code. No more typing a parent div 100 times, with a possibility of screwing it up.

08:13 - When to use nesting
* Nesting is often overused
* Only nest what you would have written un-nested with a short hand (e.g. don't nest just for the sake of it)
  * .container .item {} .container .item a {}
* Use it for scoping

10:06 - Nesting prefixes
* In order to nest CSS, you must first start it with a nesting selector

```css
.tweet {
  & > p {   }
  &.media-included { color: green; }
  & + .tweet { } // sibling
  & p { } // descentang
}
```

* Component-based — tweet, card, company, Link 

```css
article{
	color: blue;
  & {
		color: red;
  }
}
```

and must be the first child of a compound selector 

12:44 - @nest rule / media queries
* Mostly just a visual way to show nested

```css
.foo {
	display: grid;
	@media(orientation: landscape) {
    & {
			grid-auto-flow: column;
		}
	}
}
```

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;

  @media (orientation: landscape) {
    & {
      grid-auto-flow: column;
    }

    @media (min-inline-size > 1024px) {
      & {
        max-inline-size: 1024px;
      }
    }
  }
}
/* equivalent to
   .foo { display: grid; }

   @media (orientation: landscape) {
     .foo {
       grid-auto-flow: column;
     }
   }

   @media (orientation: landscape) and (min-inline-size > 1024px) {
     .foo {
       max-inline-size: 1024px;
     }
   }
 */
```
