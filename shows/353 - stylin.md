### Can it be styled? Solutions
04:28 - Just style the defaults
* Most elements can be styled, though some elements are really just multiple elements grouped together into the shadow dom and are hard to style.
* This leads to us having to re-create the visual UI, and often is a point of making inaccessible UIs.
* Select
* Input - number, date, etc.
  * Very hard to style
  * Often need `appearance: none;` for mobile
* Checkbox / Radio
* Generally speaking, these CSS Properties can be applied to all inputs:
  * font-size
  * color
  * padding
  * margin
  * background / images
  * outline (remember focus)
  * border

08:20 - Overlap with more dom elements, set background images
* Checkbox / Radio / Toggle buttons
  * Often used `:before` and `:after` along with labels â€” e.g. label + input:checked
* Select can have element overlap

14:13 - Re-implement the UI with JavaScript
* Video / Audio
  * HUGE rabbit hole of things to code
* Very important to maintain accessibility

15:46 - Use a UI Library
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Foundation](https://get.foundation/)
