## Show Notes

2:22 - What's the deal with VueJS?

* Combines ideas from Angular 1, React and Blaze
* Ease of Angular 1
* App structure of React

8:02 - Components

* Template syntax is similar to handlebars
  * aka {{stuff}}

* v-bind:property
  * v-bind:property or simply :bind allows you to dynamically bind a value to a property

* Props
  * Props must be declared before they can be used in a template.

* Script tag
  * Where imports happen
  * Where props are defined, computed properties, action events and lifecycle

* Actions
  * `v-on:click="doSomething"`
  * `@click="doSomething"`
  * These will run a doSomething event defined in your script export via methods

* Lifecycle
  * How does data fetching work?
  
* CSS
  * Can be scoped to file by adding `<style scoped>` to your property

* Global Registration
  * You can register a global component and not have to import it

36:38 - Features

* CLI
  * Easy to use when creating new projects

* Animations
  * Baked in to core
  * A transition component wraps your code and just have a `v-if` on the element you are transitioning
  * There is also more intense javascript options via `v-on`

* Routing
  * 1st party router `vue-router` with support for 3rd party routers

* Global State
  * Vuex
