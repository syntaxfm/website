05:12 - Why and when to rebase?
* `git rebase -i` is interactive
* Rebase allows you to rewind your current branch, apply the changes of another branch to it, and then on top of that, apply your new commits.
* Common uses:
  * Squash all commits into one or multiple commits
  * Reword commits
* These lines can be re-ordered — they are executed from top to bottom.
  * `p`, pick <commit> = use commit
  * `r`, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
  * `e`, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
  * `s`, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
  * `f`, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
  * `x`, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
  * `b`, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
  * `d`, drop <commit> = remove commit
  * `l`, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
  * `t`, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
  * `m`, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
