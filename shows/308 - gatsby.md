## Show Notes

03:34 - Server-rendered
* Both do server rendered
* Gatsby is done at build time
* Next is done at build and on deploy

05:26 - Static generation
* getStaticProps()
* getServerSideProps()

08:25 - Re-rendering pages
* Gatsby can be re-rendered and re-deployed - any CMS lets you do this on only the pages that changed.
* Gatsby-cloud
* Next.js has the revalidate flag that will re-render when stale

18:54 - Data management
* Gatsby has a built in GraphQL API feature with
* Next.js has nothing - it's not their problem. Use Apollo, or SWR, React Query, or redux, or whatever you want.

23:16 - Client-side data
* Neither do anything, next.

26:33 - Dynamic Pages
* List of 100 shoes, each one gets a page
* List of four types of shoes: basketball, runners, casual, bowling, etc.
* List of 10 colors: each color gets its own page.
* List of 12 sizes, each size gets its own page.
* Now it gets complicated when you do this:
    * Show me basketball shoes, in red, in size 5
    * 600 pages minimum
    * What about size 6+7?
    * Then you get into having to fetch data on the client side - but all your data is in GraphQL?!
    * The queries are different!
* Gatsby will get "Hosted GraphQL": [https://twitter.com/kylemathews/status/1252803849775009794](https://twitter.com/kylemathews/status/1252803849775009794)

30:41 - Routing
* Neither do nested routing still
* Both do folder based wrapper

34:50 - Hosting
* Anywhere

35:54 - Images
* Compression/resize
* Lazy loading
* SVG
* Blur up
* Next 10 released first revision of Next.js image
    * It's not as good as Gatbsy-image
    * Must specify width and height, whereas gatsby has fixed and fluid
    * Compression
    * No blur up
    * Yes lazy loading
    * both don't support gifs
    * Gatbsy requires annoying GraphQL query OR another plugin like MDX to do it
        * Not for long! [https://twitter.com/ascorbic/status/1320770231657238529](https://twitter.com/ascorbic/status/1320770231657238529)
    * Next.js is just `<image src=""`
    * Next does remote images
    * Neither have quality or format auto like Cloudinary does
    * Gatsby images have to be compressed at build time
    * Next.js can do it on the fly
        * assuming your server has the right tooling installed
* The GOLD STANDARD - [https://gridsome.org/docs/images/](https://gridsome.org/docs/images/)
    * Lib authors need to give this a look
* [https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1323279745275101184](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1323279745275101184)

46:20 - Server or Serverless
* Gatsby - none. You can do it with Netlify, Begin, AWS, Gatsby doesn't care.
* Next.js - can do server with API routes. Can do serverless if you host on Vercel.

49:44 - SEO
* Tags
    * Gatsby - Helmet
    * Next - Head
* Sitemap
    * Plugin for both

49:55 - Plugin Ecosystem
* Gatsby has lots of plugins that you install
* Next.js has some too. Seems Gatsby is easier in this regard because plugins can manage and normalize data into the GRaphQL Layer.

53:10 - Auth
* Neither do auth
* The first to do baked-in auth solution could get big gains.
* See Scott's Svelte Meteor accounts set up. It good. [https://github.com/leveluptuts/svelte-accounts-ui](https://github.com/leveluptuts/svelte-accounts-ui)

55:00 - E-commerce
* Gatsby - options are mostly limited to Snipcart and Shopify like iframe drop in solutions where the majority of operations take place on another site and service.
* Next.js - hey released a starter boilerplate that leans on an existing headless cart
