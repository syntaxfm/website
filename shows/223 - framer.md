## Show Notes

4:53 - The 411

* Previous knowns as Pop Motion Pose
* Animation library with focus on ease of use
* Utilizes both spring and duration based animations

7:19 - Pose

* Pose was previously more pose based - aka you made scenes and toggled between them
* This still exists within Motion as variants, but isn't the main way

8:06 - The New New

* motion.div
  * animate prop is basically a live value for the animation
  * initial for initial state
  * exit for animating out with use of animatePresence
* Hard stuff made easy
  * drag prop
* Full control over properties like duration and easing
* Orchestration features, this then that
* Variants
  * Multiple scenes allow you to orchestrate many animations with a single state change
* Handles hover and tap easily
* Scroll values
* SVG path animations

19:45 - Final Thoughts

* Framer Motion is easier
* React Spring is much smaller
* React Spring makes very complex animation possible
