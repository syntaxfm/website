## Show Notes
03:08 - What is it, what does it do?
* Framework for server-first static apps
* Use any front-end framework
* Does not ship JS unless you explicitly define a component to ship JS

05:20 - The syntax
* .astro files is a mash-up of Svelte and React
* Frontmatter for server-side JS
* Template syntax is basically JSX
* TS baked in

```html
<!-- Hydrates on load -->
<!-- <Test client:load  /> -->

<!-- Hydrates after main thread is free -->
<!-- <Test client:idle  /> -->

<!-- Hydrates as it's in viewport aka LazyLoading-->
<!-- <Test client:visible  /> -->

<!-- Hydrate when matching media query -->
<!-- <Test client:media={'(max-width: 600px)'}  /> -->

<!-- Only renders on the client -->
<!-- <Test client:only  /> -->
```

07:48 - State management
* In client-side JS only, no state in .astro files

10:50 - CSS 
* Svelte style
* Local, scoped <style> tags
* SCSS baked in

11:16 - Data fetching
* Fetch in frontmatter via fetch()

12:06 - Vs React? Vs Next? Vs Gatsby? Vs Svelte?

15:24 - Tooling
* There is a Syntax highlighter
* Uses Snowpack under the hood
