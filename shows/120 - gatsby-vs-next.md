## Show Notes

5:07 - Server Side Rendering

* Next.js will render on demand — this allows you to have server rendered pages on demand.
  * Think of a blog website — publish a new blog post and it will immediately start working.
  * Authenticated pages can be server rendered, and thus, pre-loaded for better performance.
* Gatsby runs at build time only — so you need to have all of your data ready at build time.
  * Pro: This makes for very fast page load.
  * Con: Large websites can take a long time to build.
  * Con: Gatsby can do network fetches from the client, but these lose the benefit of SSR.
* Ease of SSR:
  * Next.js requires a complicated document.js file if you are fetching data anywhere other than a page component.
    * This will probably get easier with Suspense. Demos are simple, but any real application requires harder config.
  * Gatsby is Easy Peeezy!

11:09 - Data

* Next.js is unopinionated. Like React, it doesn't care where your data comes from.
  * getInitialProps();
* Gatsby has a number of "source" plugins which will pull in data from sources — markdown, WordPress, API, file system. Once you have that data sourced, you can query it with GraphQL.

22:50 - Routing and Creating Pages

* Next.js makes you create a page in a pages directory. You can nest these as deep as you like. If you want to pass query params, you must do so with a `?query=string`. There are several third-party options for getting around this that require a node server.
* Gatsby allows you to programmatically create pages with their createPage API.
* For both navigating between pages, they make a Link Component available.

30:49 - Plugins

* In Gatsby, *everything* goes through the Gatsby pipeline. This makes things like image compression, pagination, sass, service workers and many other progressive web app pieces very easy.
* Gatsby makes building a really good website easy.
* Gatsby Image is SOOOOO amazing.
* The scope of Next.js is much smaller. They give you a few things, but you generally bring your own approach for most things
  * Routing
  * Linking and prefetching
  * Dynamic Importing

38:42 - Deploying and Hosting

* Gatsby is just HTML, CSS, and JS at the end of the day, so it can be deployed almost anywhere — Netlify, Github Pages, cheap PHP hosting, etc.
* Next.js is a Node app. It can be integrated into an existing Express app, or run by itself. Requires a Node server to run it.
* Next.js has a static generation option, but you're better off using Gatsby for that.

44:41 - The verdict?

* Use Next.js for Apps, Gatsby for Websites
