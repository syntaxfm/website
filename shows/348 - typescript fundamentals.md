### Deep end stuff
03:30 - `any vs unknown`

06:20 - `never`
* [https://twitter.com/Igorbdsq/status/1351681019196436482](https://twitter.com/Igorbdsq/status/1351681019196436482)
09:14 - .d.ts
* Definition files
* Usually for existing libraries that don't have types
* Can be generated or hand-written
* Also really handy for pure JS projects, you still get good autocomplete because of these

13:25 - Type generation
* Can be generated from GraphQL, or Schemas, or from JSON Output

17:20 - TypeScript generics (variables)
* Kind of like functions, they return something different based on what you pass it
* makeFood<Sandwich>
* makeFood<Pizza>
* This function makes food and shares lots of the same functionality between making a pizza and sandwich
  * If the only thing that differs is the type returned, we can use generics
  * You often see this as a single char T
  * It can be anything
  * Promise is a generic
  * querySelector uses generics

21:48 - Promises / Async + Await
  * Functions now return a Promise type, but with a generic
  * Promise<number>
  * Promise<Course>
  * Promise<Request<Order>>, Request<Customer>, Request<Product>
    * stringified
    * added headers

29:48 - Type assertion (type casting)
  * Type assertion is when you want to tell TypeScript "Hey I know better than you".
  * Two ways:
    * as keyword (most popular)
      * `someValue as HTMLParagraphElement`
      * Tagged before
        * <HTMLParagraphElement>someValue

34:14 - TypeScript without TypeScript ([JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) / [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/))
* Really nice!
* You can also add comments / descriptions

40:08 - Interfaces vs Types
* Interfaces have better perf
* [https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1362418379919937545](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1362418379919937545)
* [https://blog.logrocket.com/types-vs-interfaces-in-typescript/](https://blog.logrocket.com/types-vs-interfaces-in-typescript/)
* What do you default to?

### How we write TypeScript
44:27 - Interface or Types
  * Scott - Types
  * Wes - Interfaces

44:50 - `any vs unknown`
* Scott - any
* Wes - unknown / any

46:52 - Any (No Implicit or Implicit Allowed)
* Scott - No implicit any
* Wes - No implicit any

48:31 - Return types (Implicit or Explicit)
* Scott - Explicit always
* Wes - Not always

50:49 - Compile (TSC, Strip TS)
* Scott - Strip
* Wes - Both

52:38 - Type Assertion (as or <tag>)
* Scott - as
* Wes - as

53:09 - Arrays (Dog[] or Array<Dog>)
* Scott - Dog[]
* Wes - Dog[]

54:02 - Assert or Generic (if both work)
* querySelector('.thing') as HTMLVideoElement; or querySelector<HTMLVideoElement>('.thing');
* Scott - querySelector<HTMLVideoElement>('.thing');
* Wes - querySelector<HTMLVideoElement>('.thing');
