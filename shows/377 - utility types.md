## Show Notes
03:35 - Levels of using TypeScript
1. Typing your code
2. Typing your code, but getting a little bit more dynamic using utility types
3. Creating your own utility types!
* TypeScript is a language in itself
* Check out type challenges if you want your mind blown: [https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/)
* [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html)

07:29 - Partial

08:23 - ReadOnly

09:00 - Required

09:33 - Record
* A record is an object type that is a bit more restrictive
* Say you want to store podcast details - name, URL, showCount, etc., but only for Syntax and Shoptalk.

10:47 - Omit
* I find this one handy when I want to create a "Create Item" type, where it has all the item fields except the ID field

11:34 - Pick
* Given a type, pick these properties 

12:39 - Return Types
* Gives you the type that is returned from a function. Handy if you need to dynamically generate the type based on a passed function.

13:30 - Case
* These case types are useful for when you are doing template literal types
* `Uppercase<StringType>`
* `Lowercase<StringType>`
* `Capitalize<StringType>`
* `Uncapitalize<StringType>`
