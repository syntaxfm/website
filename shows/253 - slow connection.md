## Show Notes

02:26 - Types of Slow connections

* Slow upload
* Slow download
  * This could be that your kids are watching a show and your partner is on a zoom call
* High latency
* Intermittent

07:47 - Loading UI 

* Show loading UI for everything, but after X seconds
* Page transitions on SPAs
* Form switches - enter country, get list of provinces/shipping/whatever

11:58 - Account for XHR failures 

* Sometimes I'm in a loading state forever
* State machines will account for this

13:26 - "Still working" timeouts

* Some sort of timeout so the user can get feedback
