02:38 - What and why

* A headless CMS doesn't mean you have to use a static site generator
* A headless CMS has an API:
  * REST
  * GraphQL
  * GROQ
* A headless CMS can pipe its content into:
  * Static Site on build - like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
  * An app on run/refresh
  * An existing website - widget
* What makes a CMS? Do you need a UI?
* What is the threshold?
* Is a hotdog a sandwich?
* Things to think about when choosing an API
  * Auth - Rules + roles + levels
* How easy is it to create new data types?
  * Is it code or UI?
  * Can my mom use it?
* Can you create one-off content types? (e.g. settings pages)
* Custom workflows
  * dRafts, revisions, roll backs
* How are images handled? Do you need another service for that?
* Pre-determined UI
  * Is custom UI possible?
  * Two-way relationships?
  * Tags?
* Data validation?
  * UI + API?
* Hosting?
* Pricing?
* Content movability?
  * Can you get your data out?
  * Schemas
  * Users
  * Revisions
* CORS or realtime API?
* APIs
  * Can you insert data via the API? (or just pull)
  * [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) API
  * Importing data
