## Show Notes

02:39 - What is a bundler?
* On the one hand, you can write HTML, CSS and JavaScript and open it in the browser
* On the other hand, your build could be super complex

03:24 - What goes into configuring a bundler?
* Templating language you use (Jsx, Pug, Vue, etc.)
* JavaScript you write and compile to:
    * ES6/7/8/9
    * Typescript
    * CoffeeScript
* Polyfills
* Environmental variables
* CSS loading
* Image compression
* Asset Chunking
* Tree shaking

05:12 - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* Hardest to learn, most used currently

07:38 - [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/)
* Scott's pick as best option for most features vs ease of use
* Very powerful
* Mmmr, tree shaking, plugins, esm

09:52 - [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* Scott's simplicity winner pick
* Easiest to get started with
* It's a bundler, but also a dev tool
    * Hot reload
    * Local server
* Config is done via your package.json
* Lots of plugins available 

12:01 - [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn and Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* It's a dependency installer rather than a bundler

13:27 - [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)
* Scott's speed pick of the week
* Uses ESM by default
* Like Sonic after a triple shot of espresso
* HRM
* Perfect for dev builds, as well as production builds

15:51 - [Isobuild / Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
* Scott's underdog pick of the litter

16:48 - [Rome](https://rome.tools/)
* Scott's mystery pick of the week
* New tool to do it all
* Bundler, but also a linter

17:54 - [Deno](https://deno.land/)
* Linter
* Typescript formatter
* Bundler (bundle into a single .js file)

20:44 - Let your tool take care of it
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (webpack)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (webpack)
* [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
* [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
* [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs) (Rollup)
* [Broccoli.js](https://broccoli.build/)
