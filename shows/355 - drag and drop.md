## Show Notes
04:45 - What is it?
* Drag and drop is really for desktop apps
* You can drag and drop anything from any browser to any browser
* The important thing here is that this is a set of browser standards that allow different apps to communicate

07:50 - How to implement
1. Make an element draggable
2. Listen on elements for drag events
    * The events bubble up, so you can listen on the parent element as items are added/removed

09:06 - DataTransfer API
* You can store anything you want in it
* getData / setData API 
* Reference strings

11:35 - Accepting drops
* When you dragOver, you need to preventDefault()
* Calling the preventDefault() method during both a dragEnter and dragOver event will indicate that a drop is allowed at that location

13:01 - Drop Image
* Set whatever you want

16:00 - Drop Effect
* What does it look like when you drop it? Does it go back?
* dataTransfer.effectAllowed
* e.dataTransfer.setDragImage(nothing, 0, 0);

18:02 - Security concerns

20:34 - Shortcomings:
* Edge cases out the WAZOO
  * Margin caused dragout events
  * Lots of if statements
* It's up to you to do EVERYTHING
  * CSS, classes, hover styles, etc.
* Accessibility
  * Inaccessible by default, unless using mouse keys
  * Have to announce everything
* Mobile
