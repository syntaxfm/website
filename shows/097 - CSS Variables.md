## Show Notes

3:25 - What

- `--example-name`, represent custom properties
- called using `var()`
- Overwrite with a more specific style
- Use JavaScript to append .style.setPropert(

- How are they scoped?
  - Just like normal CSS
  - Can be set on :root {}
  - Can be set on any element down

9:10 - Why

- Uses:

  - Can make more sense if used semantically
  - var(--accent) vs var(--yellow)

- Independent values for things that can’t be broken up:

  - box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px red
  - transform: rotate(var(--rotate)) scale(2);

- Inline properties can be picked up by regular CSS (color, size, etc.)

  - `<p style=”--fg:red;”>hey</a>`

- Themes that can easily be changed at runtime for entire app

19:15 - Calculations

- You can use them inside of calc()
- Animations

20:10 - Bummers

- Not super well supported just yet (IE 11)
- No good fallback other than manual fallback
- Syntax - Old Browsers, Fallbacks and Polyfills series
