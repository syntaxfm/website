In this supper club episode of Syntax, Wes and Scott talk with Jonny Burger about why and how he built Remotion, his app that lets you create MP4 videos using React.

## Gatsby - Sponsor

Today’s episode was sponsored by Gatsby, the fastest frontend for the headless web. Gatsby is the framework of choice for content-rich sites backed by a headless CMS as its GraphQL data layer makes it straightforward to source website content from anywhere. Gatsby’s opinionated, React-based framework makes the hardest parts of building a performant website simpler. Visit [Gatsby.dev/Syntax](https://gatsby.dev/Syntax) to get your first Gatsby site up in minutes and experience the speed. ⚡️

## Tuple - Sponsor

This week’s sponsor is [Tuple](https://tuple.app/syntax), an app built specifically for remote pair programming. The app is written in C++ and tuned for high-resolution screen sharing and low-latency remote control. Because developers deserve better than Zoom or Meet for pairing.
