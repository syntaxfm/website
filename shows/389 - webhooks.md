In this Hasty Treat, Scott and Wes talk about webhooks — one of those concepts that seems a lot scarier than it actually is.

## Show Notes
03:42 - What are webhooks?
* User-defined HTTP callbacks
* When something happens, ping this URL with this data
* Examples:
  * When something sells, ping this URL
  * When someone reverses a charge, lock their account
  * Trigger a build of the website when the content changes
  * Then someone buys a shirt, generate a shipping label and save it to the DB

07:57 - Sending End
* Can be a great way to hook two services together

09:13 - Receiving End
* Often you will be the one that accepts the webhook ping
* In this case, you set up an endpoint

11:00 - Payloads
* Almost all will send a JSON body that you parse out
* The method send is variable

11:51 - Auth
* On the receiving end of a webhook, you often get a token which you can then ping the service with. It will tell you if that request was legit or not. 
* On the sending end, you can often set up headers with auth - same with the method
* Can be a replacement for a serverless function

13:18 - Testing webhooks
