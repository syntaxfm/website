* Set default headers in your request library - this way it comes along for the ride on every request
* Don’t get hung up on “static” - static sites can be as dynamic as needed
* Don’t wait to use new tech - progressively enhance and gracefully degrade where needed
* There are many JAMStack libraries in the sea - there are many different approaches so don't be afraid to experiment
* Side projects are key to learning - test out new tech on smaller projects first and get comfortable with it
