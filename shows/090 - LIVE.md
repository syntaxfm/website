7:14 - Spicy JAM Tips

- Set default headers in your request library - this way it comes along for the ride on every request
- Don’t get hung up on “static” - static sites can be as dynamic as needed
- Don’t wait to use new tech - progressively enhance and gracefully degrade where needed
- There are many JAMStack libraries in the sea - there are many different approaches so don't be afraid to experiment
- Side projects are key to learning - test out new tech on smaller projects first and get comfortable with it
