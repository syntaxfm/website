## Show Notes
03:59 - [cudd.io](https://cudd.io/)
* Shared component animation between home / about really nice
* Readable, clear
* Simple
* Check the contrast ratio on the white text on light blue: [https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-56ccf2](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-56ccf2)
* Nice SSR from [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* CSS vars
* Very tall cards without much text, looks like a mistake
* Better on a short browser window - peep the tall and skinny
* Card heading should be h3 or h4

10:35 - [damonbolesta.com](https://damonbolesta.com/)
* Nice design = super fun!
* Good color palette
* Shows your skills straight up
* Animation
* Not accessible - EASY fixes with [Axe Dev Tools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/)
* Text on background images hard to read
* White text on buttons
* Bold some words in your bio
* Border radius

21:52 - [walterkjenkins.com](https://www.walterkjenkins.com/)
* Map is fun
* Contrast issues with the color choices
* Transparency not needed on body content
* Cursive font for links / buttons is a no for me dog
* Labels on social media icons
* Hero overlaps section below it
* Maps data processing should be h4

29:40 - [suhit.me](https://suhit.me/)
* This is an example of a really good one
* Wicked domain name
* Design is ON POINT, like this is the type of polish I like to see - I'd hire on this
* Can't get enough [Inter font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
* Fun little animation
* I'd go a little easier on the box-shadow
* Github even has a custom readme
* Resume
  * Very modern - JS, TS, Bootstrap
  * TypeScript A+
  * Drop the "5" and "3" from "HTML" and "CSS"
  * I'd add color to the resume, its likely not printed
  * Don't need to say Github and LinkedIn in front of the URLs

37:20 - [jacobpawlak.com](https://jacobpawlak.com/)
* Initial loading is great - transitions are hot
* Typography looks nice - not sure about those serif all-cap nav items
* Slider not very usable
* View circle on hover is cool, but I'm not sure about following your mouse, covers text
* T-shirt portfolio is awesome
* Fun little bits in the footer
* SSL is broken - fix that sh!t
* Links don't show over background images - common issue today
* External links should probably be indicated as such
* HTML, paragraphs as h3 & h4, h5, should be <p> - (i.e. "here are a few of my recently completed..." should be a <p>)
* Design of resume is KEY - different colors, eh?

47:04 - [mrtnvh.com](https://mrtnvh.com/)
* This is a good example of subtle flex of skills
* FAST AF
* Makes you say "Ohhhh" when you click a link (something that's missing from a lot of these single page sites)
* Personal Photo A+
* Position sticky
* Love the skills layout on the about page
* Email is a button
  * I can't copy your email
  * We have mailto links - don't reinvent
* A+
