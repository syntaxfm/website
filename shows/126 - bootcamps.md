  * Led and created first bootcamp at HackerYou
  * Led and created first JS part-time at HackerYou

10:02 - School - $$$

* Pros
  * The best thing about school was unrestricted free time to find out what I enjoyed, which lead me to coding
  * Co-ops can help you find what you like and what you don't like
  * Life skills that involve you being on your own and figuring things out more
  * You are exposed to interesting people and ideas
  * CS Degree work can open more career doors
  * Professional networking
  * Many companies wont hire you without some sort of bachelor's degree (this might change)

* Cons
  * Not everyone has the time or money to devote two to five years to school — especially to something they might not end up enjoying
  * Potentially outdated staff and course material
    * Wes was often asked to lead a video editing course, print design course and a web development course
  * Lot's of distractions

23:10 - Bootcamp - $$

* Pros
  * Very fast, lots of info, but can be a bit overwhelming
  * You can get up-to-speed extremely quickly
  * Focused on hire-ability and job-ready skills
  * Focused information
  * Personality is really the deciding factor here - lots of people do well, and some don't

* Cons
  * Hit or miss — quality of bootcamps aren't vetted, so do your research
  * Talk to someone who took it, find out who the instructors are
  * You absolutely must continue learning after the bootcamp
    * The bootcamp is just a push and you are expected to continue learning once you are done
  * Not great for individuals that can't handle the pace
  * You have to quit your job

37:09 - Self-Taught - $

* Pros
  * Self-directed people will prevail here
  * Can be drip-fed while earning money at another job
  * Can be supplemented by a job (e.g. you are front-end and want to go full stack)
  * Can get real world experience as a freelancer while you evolve

* Cons
  * Not for everyone
  * Can be difficult to self-motivate
  * Hard to get help - sometimes you can be stuck for hours on a two-second fix
  * Potentially discouraging
  * You might go down the wrong path without guidance on what you should learn

47:11 - Part Time Programs - $

* Pros
  * Fantastic way to get up to speed with a new tech
  * Goes at a good pace - twice a week usually
  * Offered on weekends and evenings where you can maintain a regular job
  * Very low risk - you can try it out

* Cons
  * Might not be as fast as you like it
  * Quality is all over the map

49:55 - Mentored Self Learning - $

* Pros
  * Best to do with a mentor on the job
  * Mentor can help steer what to learn in your free time
  * Good feedback and a place to ask lots of questions

* Cons
  * Can't be done without someone willing to mentor you
  * Only as good as your mentor

52:55 - What approach would we take?

* Bootcamp > then immediately supplement with courses
