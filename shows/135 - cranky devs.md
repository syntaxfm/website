In this Hasty Treat, Scott and Wes talk about cranky developers â€” those devs who never seem happy about anything, always mad about tech choices, and constantly writing off any new tech as simply a "fad" or unnecessary.

2:20 - How to deal with cranky devs

* Many experienced developers prefer older, stable technology for a reason. They have been through it before. 

7:14 - Questions to ask when considering new tech:

* Is it better for the product?
* Is it better for the users?
* Is it better for the business?
* Is it better for the developer?

16:39 - How to convince them:

* Proof of concept - show them it's better.

18:28 - Things to acknowledge:

* There are risks in changing technologies.
* There are costs - training, tooling, hosting.

21:20 - Some people are not interested in improving themselves

* They got the job they want and are short sighted about the future.
* You can appeal to management about making progressive choices.
* If management isn't interested, you should look for a new job.
