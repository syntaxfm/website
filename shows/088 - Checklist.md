In this episode Wes and Scott discuss their pre-launch checklists. They talk about performance, accessibility, compatibility, SEO, analytics, and more - all the things you should check before launching something to the world.

## Sentry - Sponsor

If you want to know what's happening with your errors, track them with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Sentry is open-source error tracking that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. Cut your time on error resolution from five hours to five minutes. It works with any language and integrates with dozens of other services. Syntax listeners can get two months for free by visiting [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) and using the coupon code "tastytreat".

## .tech Domains - Sponsor

Finding a great domain name is tough with so many names already taken. If you're looking for a domain name for your startup, side project, or anything at all, check out [.tech Domains](https://get.tech). Syntax listeners can get 90% off both one-year, five-year and ten-year registration by visiting [go.tech/syntax](https://go.tech/syntax) and using the coupon code "syntax".
