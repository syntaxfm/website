## Show Notes
04:20 - HTML
* HTML is the language you write to get text and elements to show up on the screen
* Elements can describe the content they contain
  * p
  * img
* Or be structural and describe the areas of the website
  * div
  * h
  * header, footer
* Listen to our ep on HTML elements to learn more about them: [Syntax 354: The Surprisingly Exciting World of HTML Elements](https://syntax.fm/show/354/the-surprisingly-exciting-world-of-html-elements)
* HTML elements have default styling applied to them before you write any CSS
  * This comes from the browser and can be manipulated
  * However, by default all elements are either block or inline-display

08:11 - CSS
* If HTML is the bones, CSS is the clothes and skin
* CSS dictates how a website looks
  * Without CSS, you have text on a blank page and images
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets ("cascading" being the key word)
* Adding CSS to a page
  * Link tag
  * Style tag
  * Inline styles
* Selectors
  * You can select an element on the page via element, class, id, attribute
  * Syntax is selector, brackets, property, value
* Property
  * A property is what you are changing (e.g. background-color)
* Value determines how the thing looks
  * `background: red;`
* Specificity
  * Specificity is a big part of the cascade. When you apply one style to something, you need to learn how to target things appropriately. This is a huge part of being good at CSS.
  * People develop systems like BEM to organize this
  * General rules - Use elements for base styling and classes for specific styling. Don't use IDs for styling.
  * `!important` exists to override everything, but as a general rule, NEVER use it. Seriously.
* Some interaction
  * Most interaction is done in JavaScript, but CSS has some basics
    * hover, active, focus
* Pseudo selectors
* You'll often see people reaching for libraries to make CSS easier and more consistent
  * Common examples are Bootstrap, Foundation, and TailwindCSS
  * For the most part you'll want to avoid these until you have a good understanding of the cascade, how CSS works, and how to write good CSS.
* In addition to properties, you can now write your own custom properties for CSS.
  * While this could be seen as an advanced technique, I believe the new normal is CSS variables first.
  * CSS variables are indicated by `—variableName: value;` where variable name takes the place of a property.
  * You can then use the variable via var(—variableName) in place of a property. This allows for easy duplication of same values across your style sheet.

37:08 - JavaScript
* JavaScript is used to add *interaction* to a website
* It makes your website dynamic

**JavaScript the Language**
* We have a base programming language that has nothing to do with HTML
* It has things like:
  * Variables - ways to store things
  * Numbers + Math
  * Data Containers - Objects and Arrays
  * Functions - Code grouped together to achieve a certain purpose
* It also has a "Standard Lib" which means JavaScript comes with built-in support for doing common things:
  * Formatting time + money
  * Alerting the user
  * Logging a value to developer tools
  * Capitalizing things
  * Sorting lists of things
  * Round or randomize numbers
  * Fetch data
  * Talk to a sever
* Promises
  * Logic and flow control

**JavaScript the DOM**
* When the HTML is loaded, it's parsed into something called the DOM (Document Object Model)
* Events
  * JavaScript is mostly event-driven - when something happens, do something else
  * When you click something and want something else to happen
  * There are lots of events
    * mouse, touch, pointer
    * Ready
    * Forms
      * Submit, change, keyboard, etc.
* Can be used to fetch data
  * `fetch()` - you'll often hear it called Ajax, or XMLHttpRequest
* Can be used to make more HTML
  * Whole set of APIs for creating elements
* The DOM can be traversed
