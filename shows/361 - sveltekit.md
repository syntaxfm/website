## Show Notes
03:28 - What is it?
* Total platform for building [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) apps
* Built in [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
	* Includes all of the Vite goodness but it hides behind the scenes for the most part
* Host anywhere

05:16 - Is it CSR, SSR, SSG, WTF?!
* All of the above. Uses adapters to control the output:
```jsx
kit: {
		// hydrate the <div id="svelte"> element in src/app.html
		target: '#svelte',
		adapter: adapter()
}
```

09:45 - What you get out of the box
* File-based routing
* API routes
* Layouts and layout resets
* Fancy file titles [slug] __layout
* Code splitting & preloading
* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support

17:03 - Neat small things
* Glob import
