In this Hasty Treat, Scott and Wes talk about feature and release planning — dealing with bugs, task management, best practices, and more!

## Show Notes

4:06 - Wes:

* Features are logged into software (Github, Jira, etc.)
* I use a Kanban board - I bubble them up and down in the order in which I want to release them
* I don't plan for Q1, Q1, etc.. 
* Tear off an issue, tackle it, test and deploy.

10:39 - Scott: 

* All issues/features get a priority tag (e.g. p1 → p4) regardless of the system
* Bugs go in Github
* Features and platform improvements go in Notion
* Table of priorities (with git branch, lead dev, release number, emoji icon, what it contains, etc.)
