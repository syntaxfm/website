## Show Notes
03:44 - What is Just?
* [https://github.com/angus-c/just](https://github.com/angus-c/just)
* No dependencies
* It's written in JS, so you can copy+paste them if you really need it
* Types available
* [https://medium.com/@angustweets/just-a12d54221f65#.ljib0mfr5](https://medium.com/@angustweets/just-a12d54221f65#.ljib0mfr5)

06:46 - Some nice ones
* just-safe-set → deeply setting dynamic object properties
  * `set(data, 'a.long[0].path', value)`
* object-typeof
  * Why not use `typeof`?
    * Everything is an object
  * Why not use `array.isArray`?
    * Handy to have a switch statement
* just-*-case
  * Camel, kebab, snake
* just-compare

10:54 - Why?
* This is the NPM install of Stack Overflow copy+paste
* Handy as hell
* Battle-tested
  * Lots of ways to do simple stuff
  * Sometimes the simple stuff has weird edge cases - these are caught
* Sometimes your checks can be messy
  * Check if an object is empty
  * 25 lines
  * Just install it

12:05 - Other
* Great to learn and test yourself
* There are tests for each function
  * Run them
  * See them fail
  * Try and make it so all the tests pass without looking at the source
