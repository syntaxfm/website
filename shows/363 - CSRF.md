* SameSite Cookie

  * Lax — Default value in modern browsers. Cookies are allowed to be sent with top-level navigations and will be sent along with GET requests initiated by a third party website. The cookie is withheld on cross-site subrequests, such as calls to load images or frames, but is sent when a user navigates to the URL from an external site, such as by following a link.
  * Strict — As the name suggests, this is the option in which the Same-Site rule is applied strictly. Cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and not be sent along with requests initiated by third party websites. The browser sends the cookie only for same-site requests (that is, requests originating from the same site that set the cookie). If the request originated from a different URL than the current one, no cookies with the SameSite=Strict attribute are sent.
  * None — Cookies will be sent in all contexts, i.e sending cross-origin is allowed. The browser sends the cookie with both cross-site and same-site requests.
