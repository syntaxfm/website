01:54 - The problem
* This only affects the client-side

05:28 - What are some solutions:
* Do nothing and hope the  user refreshes.
* Have a list of assets, or commit hashes. Poll the server periodically, and when there is a new version available:
    * Prompt the user to refresh
    * Just refresh the user (store current state in localstorage and restore)
* Do a custom <Link> component, that checks the last time the user has refreshed (or if new version if available). When they click the link, render a regular <a> instead of a pushstate link.
* Use a service worker. They will emit an event when a new version is available. Use the above methods to refresh the user.
* Hot code push.
    * Vuepress has "hot reloading" baked in.
