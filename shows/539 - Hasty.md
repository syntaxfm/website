In this Hasty Treat, Scott and Wes talk about the new proposal for React, what the basics of it are, why it's being proposed, and some benefits and issues it brings up.

## Sentry - Sponsor

If you want to know what’s happening with your code, track errors and monitor performance with Sentry. Sentry’s Application Monitoring platform helps developers see performance issues, fix errors faster, and optimize their code health. Cut your time on error resolution from hours to minutes. It works with any language and integrates with dozens of other services. Syntax listeners new to Sentry can get two months for  free by visiting [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and using the coupon code TASTYTREAT during sign up.

## Auth0 - Sponsor

Auth0 is the easiest way for developers to add authentication and secure their applications. They provides features like user management, multi-factor authentication, and you can even enable users to login with device biometrics with something like their fingerprint. Not to mention, Auth0 has SDKs for your favorite frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node/Express. Make sure to sign up for a free account and give Auth0 a try with the link below.
