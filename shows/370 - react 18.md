## Show Notes
04:32 - Automatic Batching
* Don't worry about re-renders 

08:32 - New Render API
```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```
* No more hydrate method (yay!)

10:44 - Suspense
```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <ProfilePage resource={resource} />
      </Suspense>
```
* Suspense is basically a promise resolver component - nothing inside will render until promise is resolved.
* SuspenseList lets you coordinate the order in which loading indicators show up.

16:43 - StrictEffects Mode
* [https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/19](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/19)
* Will allow components to mount, unmount, and mount again
* Will help with fastrefresh and really good dev experience

18:43 - useTransition() Hook
* Not an animation hook. They named it this because of the future ability to add animations to React core. 
* Wrap the state update in a "transition" to prevent the ProfilePage from being unmounted while suspending. This lets React know that it should wait for the update to complete.
* We classify state updates in two categories:
  * Urgent updates reflect direct interaction, like typing, hover, dragging, etc.
  * Transition updates transition the UI from one view to another.

23:11 - SSR Improvements
* React.Lazy will work on the Server
* Finally!
* [https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37) 
* Server-side rendering (abbreviated to “SSR” in this post) lets you generate HTML from React components on the server, and send that HTML to your users. **SSR lets your users see the page’s content before your JavaScript bundle loads and runs.**
* React Server Components

34:45 - ELI5
* [https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/46](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/46)

36:37 - Next.js
* Next.js will probably have support for a lot of these features soon.
