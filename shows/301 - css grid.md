06:10 - How it works
* `masonry-auto-flow: next;`
  1. It first puts all the items that are explicitly placed onto the grid. Items that you have a set start/stop value for are first put down.
  2. Then it takes the next item that it to be placed and finds a spot for it. This is different because with CSS Grid you normally have to place the next item on the next row or column.
  3. `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` can now be marked as masonry and this specifies which axis will be masonry.

09:06 - The implicit grid
* [https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#%23implicit-grid](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#%23implicit-grid)
* The implicit grid is formed in the same way as a regular grid container. However, it’s only used in the grid axis.
* Interesting in a column situation (see images).

13:25 - Thoughts
* Power tools for layout in CSS — opens up a ton of possibilities and completes the functionality we use to dream of in CSS.
