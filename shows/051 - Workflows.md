## Show Notes

4:00 - Design Workflow

- Wes:

  - Screenshots of look + feels
  - Sketch layouts out in pencil
  - Mock up layout in Sketch
  - Once rough layout is done, I refine
  - Once I have: colors, type, patterns, textures and overall layout, I move to code.
  - A design program is important to vs designing in code

- Scott
  - Mirrored component structure in Figma
  - Using Ideas from Atomic design and React components
  - Goal is for Figma components to be 100% mapped to styled components
  - Flexible and testable in different layouts
  - My design philosophy is refinement through iteration
  - Light theft
    - Footer from [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/)
    - New card animation idea from [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/)

15:55 - Design to Dev Workflow

- Wes:

  - Happy with design so far
  - Setup tooling - styled components, stylus, sass...
  - Setup type, variables, partials, resets...
  - Do as much HTML as possible before styling
  - CSS it up for layouts, then go section by section
  - Broad first, then zoom in on finesse
  - Browsersync / Hot Reload
  - Test across browsers / Devices

- Scott:
  - Define parameters in Figma
  - Styled components in React, hand write that CSS bruh
  - Move aspects of styled components lib like breakpoints, colors, functions, helpers, base components

32:06 - Git Workflow

- Wes:

  - Tear off a branch - name after issue - DEV113
  - Do your work
  - Rebase
  - Squash
  - Pull Request
  - Rinse + Repeat

- Scott
  - Master branch is 1-1 with live
  - Develop is where work is done (but not really because I make a feature branch for each feature and merge in)
  - Contributors issue pull requests into develop

42:34 - Deployment Workflow

- Scott:

  - Hosted on Meteor Galaxy, container based hosting
  - Develop is merged into master, all tests run, if everything passes tests and manual check, I deploy to Galaxy via NPM script.
  - Soon I'll be adding in automated test running & auto deploy to galaxy on push to master.
  - Secrets are kept in a settings.json file that's used during deployment.

- Wes:
  - Codeship
  - DeployHQ
  - Git
  - Rsync
  - Dealing with secrets
