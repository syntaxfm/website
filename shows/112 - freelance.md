## Show Notes

03:29 - Gathering Requirements

* Probably the most important part of the process. If you botch this, you'll be dealing with change orders and scope-creep throughout the entire project. Poor planning is why agencies have project managers and why many freelancers hate their clients.
* Ask lots of questions
* Get lots of examples
* Break down each page into functionality
* Ask about budget
* Clarify who will be updating the site
* Do this in person if possible

17:00 - Quote

* Figuring out the quote
* Break it down into major functional areas that don't necessarily depend on each other.
* Multi-staged quotes are great because if it's too expensive, the client knows they can add additional features later in the project.
* Explain the tech you will use in relation to how it will help their business, or how easy it will be for them to manage.
* Presenting the quote
    * List what will be included
    * List what won't be included
    * Make your quote valid for two weeks
    * Create a template that looks professional
        * Our agency had a professional template, printed on heavy paper in an embossed folder with our logo on it.
    * You don't have to go this far, but experience matters. Think Apple. You can quote more if you have a higher perception of quality.

30:20 - Timelines

* Timelines should include hard dates. You should have a "hard on" and and "hard off".
* Assume 24-hour turnaround on questions
* Be generous with your estimates. Under promise, over deliver.
* Quoting time is a huge skill

35:58 - Contract

* You best have one
* Spell out what the client is getting (from quote)
* At the very least, have the client sign your quote
* Clear communication and a good relationship is extremely important
* Use online templates, or have a lawyer create something specific

41:09 - Setting Expectations

* Don't make yourself available 24/7
* Establish a professional environment by not being too casual
* Your choices will set the course for your relationship
* Don't be too quick to reply to email
* Schedule emails for 10a.m.
