## Show Notes

### React

03:53 - Unmount delay for animation

06:20 - Suspense with SSR released (or not because I think they are shelving it)

* Dan's tweet: [https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259614150386425858](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259614150386425858)

09:24 - File based components

* Like Svelte and Vue
* This would look like a file with a special scoped `<style>` tag per page.

11:50 - Prevent Default shortcuts

13:00 - No more useIsoLayoutEffect

* useLayoutEffect on SSR should just work without a custom hook
* Simple data fetching strategy based on promises

15:52 - Recommended hooks

* E.g. "here is the best way to do things"
* Official list of best practice hooks

18:25 - A good form strategy

* Bind inputs to state directly without any change handlers
* Inputs and forms all around need more magic - it's painful

20:43 - Write once deploy everywhere

* Not likely ever
* E.g. automatic transformation into react-native (obviously not going to happen)

22:28 - Compile time directives

* [https://github.com/bukharim96/directive-x](https://github.com/bukharim96/directive-x)

25:11 - Slots instead of children

* Allows for things like named slots more explicit than children

### JSX

26:44 - Removal of htmlFor, className and all other abominations of html

29:09 - Import Raact from React for JSX to work

* Soon will be fixed [https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11154](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11154)
  * [react-require](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-require)

32:31 - Better conditional / if statement syntax

33:09 - Fragments by default

* Just do it for us - the error message already knows

33:54 - Automatic key ids

* If mapping an object, check for common `_id` or id

36:36 - Simple scoped CSS built in

37:29 - Short hand for props with same name is prop={prop}

39:00 - Prop interpolation without backticks: name="$first $last"

* Or just backticks without brackets name=`${first} ${last}` instead of name={`${first} ${last}`}

### Tooling

39:43 - Story for typescript/prettier/babel

40:11 - Automatic a href client side routing

41:51 - Scaffolding and component generation
