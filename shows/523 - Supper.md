## FireHydrant - Sponsor

Incidents are hard. Managing them shouldn’t be. FireHydrant makes it easy for anyone in your organization to respond to incidents efficiently and consistently. Intuitive, guided workflows provide turn-by-turn navigation for incident response, while thoughtful prompts and powerful integrations capture all of your incident data to drive useful retros and actionable analytics.

## Gatsby - Sponsor

Today’s episode was sponsored by Gatsby, the fastest frontend for the headless web.

Gatsby’s opinionated, React-based framework makes the hardest parts of building a performant website simpler.
