4:05 - What is Serverless?

* URL driven
* Startup/shut down (Heroku works this way)
* Digital Ocean droplet works differently

8:15 - What are the benefits?

* Scale up specific functions rather than everything - aka potentially cheaper
* Security - your singular server instance being hacked is not a possibility
* Less knowledge overhead required
  * You don't need to manage your own server
  * Empowers front-end devs to do more
* Faster deploys
  * Only re-deploy the code that changed

17:05 - What can you host on Serverless?

- Static Files - SPA (React)
- Single functions
- It can be in JS, Python, GO, PHP

18:07 - What can't you host on Serverless?

* Entire applications
* Large apps have slow coldstarts
* 500mb limit 

23:40 - Raw Providers

* Google Cloud
* Azure
* AWS Lambda 
* SAP
* Red Hat
* IBM Cloud Functions
* Cloudflare Workers 
* Kind of cool because they work like service workers where you can intercept any HTTP request

27:33 - Easy Providers + Frameworks

* Begin + Arc.codes
* Zeit Now + Next.js
* Anything + Serverless 
* Netlify
* AWS Amplify
* Apex Up - TJ Holowaychuk
