## Show Notes

5:05 - How can you help a designer understand how styling works and how layouts work in the web? In other words: How do I explain my boundaries as a front-end developer to a designer?

* Work closely with the designer
* Allow the designer to push your limits
* You can help them understand by:
  * Showing them poor performing websites
  * Showing them things that usually are taxing on the GPU to paint - rotations, background images, drop shadows, etc.
* Don’t be afraid to let a tough design push your boundaries

13:23 - How do you manage your time for learning new things when you have children and a daily full-time job?

* Those who figure out how to make it a priority will win out
* Family first - talk to your spouse
* Ask your boss for time to learn and grow
* Find ways to get paid for learning

19:45 - How do you deal with burnout in this constantly evolving front end tech ecosystem?

* Make time for hobbies away from the computer
* Do projects just for fun
* Solve your own problems
* [Syntax 035: Keeping Up with the Codeashians](https://syntax.fm/show/035/keeping-up-with-the-codeashians-dealing-with-our-fast-paced-industry)
* [Syntax 041: Preventing and Dealing with Burnout in Web Development](https://syntax.fm/show/041/preventing-and-dealing-with-burnout-in-web-development)

25:00 - Do you code at night (past 9pm)?

* Start your wind-down time earlier
* Let your brain wok on problems while you sleep
* Get it out of your head
* Listen to podcasts, audiobooks, etc.

29:23 - How do you compress your videos/audio for your courses/tutorials?

* Handbrake Fast 1080
* Use presets
* Output from video editor, rip from YouTube, or compress directly from video editor

33:10 - It seems like in the web dev community, a lot of people give WordPress crap. Any idea why?

* WordPress is dope - people just like to complain.
* WordPress is often one of the first things people learn and have bad memories of it
* It's easy to write bad code with WordPress
* It can be slow
* It can attract a certain type of developer

33:10 - What are some of the biggest mistakes that people make when they are learning programming and what's the best way to overcome them?

* Don't focus on too many things
* Don't worry about picking the right technology
* Focus on the fundamentals
* Let your curiosity and excitement drive you
* Celebrate wins

40:29 - What are your best tips for writing documentation?

* Start with basic API documentation, them move to more "article style" docs
* Use tools like [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
* [Syntax 073: Reading Documentation](https://syntax.fm/show/073/hasty-treat-reading-documentation)

43:08 - What are some good questions or techniques to better understand a client's requirements?

* How does your business work right now?
* What are people coming to the website for?
* Questionnaires are good - they get people thinking
* It’s your job to understand what a client want out of a website - what problems they have and need solved

45:38 - Do you guys have any tips for taking over maintenance and development of existing websites where the previous developer is no longer reachable?

* Take time to asses the codebase before writing anything
* Learn what’s there any and why
* Don't start ripping out code without understanding what's really going on
* Don't leave it worse than you found it
* It depends on the stack, but it's probably worth giving it an honest go before re-writing the whole thing
