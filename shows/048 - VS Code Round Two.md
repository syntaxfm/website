40:35 - Tips and Tricks

* Learn how to jump and select by letter, word, line, etc.
* Move a line (or Line Bubbling) - Use this for rearranging and/or moving lines of code quickly.
* Cycling through multiple windows of the same app - If you have multiple VS Code windows open, "Cmd + backtick" will cycle through them, so you don't have to drag them in and out of view.
* Adjust MacOS keyboard settings - change Key Repeat to "fast" and Delay Until Repeat to "short". This will make your editor super fast when holding down arrow keys.
* Use Git features
  * [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)
* Spell Checker - "Cmd + ." will open up code actions and you check for possible misspellings, etc.
  * [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
* Rename Symbol - Much more reliable than find/replace.
* [Sort Lines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.sort-lines)
* Select everything between quotes - (Cmd + Shift + Space)

57:25 - Things that could be improved

* Region folding is inconsistent and sometimes doesn't work at all.
* No easy way to tell which extension is causing CPU performance issues.
* Sidebar indentation isn't clear.
