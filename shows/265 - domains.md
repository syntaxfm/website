02:25 - How it works

We pick a TLD from a list, and the other person needs to guess:

1. Is it for a country or business? +5 points
2. What country, business, or type of business is it for? +5 points
3. How much per year does it cost to register? You may also say "unregisterable" +/- off by $$ [https://www.101domain.com/](https://www.101domain.com/)
4. Is scott.**_ and wes._** available? -10 points for each

04:00 - .sd

* Scott: 5 + -5 + -126 + -10 + 10 = -126

05:46 - .ong

* Wes: 5 + -5 + -30 + 20 = -10

07:53 - .koeln

* Scott: 5 + -5 + -20 + 20 = -126

09:23 - .co.ke

* Wes:  10 + -15 + 0 = -15

11:00 - .tr 

* Scott: 5 + -5 + 0 + 0 = -126

12:25 - .ist
