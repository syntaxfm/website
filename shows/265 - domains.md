02:25 - How it works

We pick a TLD from a list, and the other person needs to guess:

1. Is it for a country or business? +5 points
2. What country, business, or type of business is it for? +5 points
3. How much per year does it cost to register? You may also say "unregisterable" +/- off by $$ [https://www.101domain.com/](https://www.101domain.com/)
4. Is scott.**_ and wes._** available? -10 points for each
