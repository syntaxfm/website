## Show Notes

6:35 - Our backgrounds in design

12:41 - Foundations

* Consistency makes a big difference
* Use "training wheel" tools until you are confident
* Always work within a system
* Less is more - subtle is better

19:39 - Color

* Color theory
* Complementary colors and shades
* Stick to color pallet generators until you are good enough

28:51 - Spacing

* More spacing than you think you need
* Vertical rhythm
* Letter spacing: -1px
* Consistent margin and padding

34:47 - Typography

* Sans vs serifs
* Finding fonts
* Use proven combinations until you know your way around

41:49 - Interaction

* Design for all states (e.g. standard, visited, active, hover, etc.)
* Animations should be quick
* Interactions should make sense

45:04 - Concerns beyond visuals

* Accessibility via color contrast
* Thin fonts and light grey are awful
* Think about the poor Windows users

48:47 - Inspiration + Resources

* Take inspiration from the best — you'll find your own voice after enough work
* Go easy on trends - blobby characters with purple hair
* Take a trip around the world wide web
