Once you are in, you\'re can lean anything you want.\n* Follow your heart - but have a plan\n\n51:03 - Should I be a generalist or a specialist?\n\n* Wes: There is nothing wrong with having a large skillset as long as you aren’t mediocre at everything. If you\'re optimizing for hire-ability I think having a defined focus on either front-end or back-end is best, but still an understanding of how the other works. Ideally you have 1) Very good JS skills, 2) an understanding of how things work on both ends.\n\n* Scott: You can do either, but whatever you do, do it well. It’s easier to do a few things well than many things well. That said there are some virtuosic devs out there who can be amazing at many things, however those people are not common. Most people have holes in their armor.\n\n## Links\n\n* [JAMstack_conf](https://jamstackconf.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n\n* Scott: [Great British Baking Show](https://www.pbs.org/show/great-british-baking-show/)\n* Wes:\n  * [Pointless Packaging Instagram](https://instagram.com/pointless_packaging)\n  * [Ozark Season 2](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117552)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n\n* [Scott\'s React Testing for Beginners Course](https://LevelUpTutorials.com/pro)\n* [Wes\' Advanced React Course](https://wesbos.com/courses)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '969d6de20df41ed84921c41e991eb0e3fff20660a5f3d82a43d84638fba5c9f3', 'specialization-vs-generalization', '/shows/076 - Specialization.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:56.060', '2023-10-27 15:57:44.236', 'TASTY'),

It\'s a clearly written, example-rich book, introducing front-end developers to the React framework and related tools. Not everyone likes learning from a video. If that\'s you, [React In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/react-in-action) is a great book that covers everything you need to know. Also be sure to check out this page for [40% off all manning books and videos](http://deals.manning.com/webdev/).\n\n## Show Notes\n\n2:29\n\n* I listened to your episode on Freelancing and I was wondering how to justify an increase in my hourly rate. You mentioned that you just increased it to $100/hr and nobody griped, but I seem to have a steady stream of clients who want things for free or nearly free and I usually have that fear that if I charge them more, then I won\'t get the business. Thoughts?\n\n6:55\n\n* I\'ve started a YouTube web development channel. Recently, I was approached to produce content for money for another website. For some reason, I immediately thought I might be taken advantage of (I\'m pretty new and it\'s odd to be offered something like this so quickly, no?) if accepting. What do you think? Should I create content for a (small) website that I never heard of or continue with YouTube (or both)?\n\n14:00\n\n* I\'ve read on Twitter that React.Context can be a good replacement for Redux. Why?\n\n18:40\n\n* What\'s it like running a podcast?!\n\n24:03\n\n* I\'ve seen a rise in the term \"full-stack designer\". Is this a title you think will become a real thing? Someone capable of overseeing a project from concept to prototype? Thanks!\n\n27:36\n\n* What has been the most awkward situation you’ve been in as a dev?\n\n31:20\n\n* Do you have any good resources on JWT? I’m unclear when my front end needs to send what to my back end, to ensure my sites and only my sites can get the data requested from my server. Thanks for everything you do!\n\n35:34\n\n* How do you move selected text horizontally (or vertically) in VSCode? I\'ve seen it in Wes\' videos and I tried to ask him on Twitter, but I\'m sure that is a chore to keep up with. I\'ve googled a ton, but the only thing I found was an extension that adjusts indentation, which is not really what I\'m after.\n\n38:57\n\n* How do you recommend providing feedback on \"bad\" code to a developer more experienced than you, without coming off as an uppity, know-it-all junior who just read a bunch of textbooks??\n\n42:39\n\n* How do you set up an IP whitelist? I am just getting started managing databases and I am using Mongo Atlas. They require an IP whitelist for all connections. Developing from my computer is fine because I can just add my IP to the whitelist, but what do I do if I actually want to make my API or website public? Just whitelist everything?

How do you call Pixels? Which tools do you use for optimizing Images?   \n\n5:02\n\n* What are your thoughts on TypeScript (and selfishly, I\'d like to learn about using it with React)? Any temptation to try it out if you\'re not already doing so? Why or why not? Any resources you\'d like to share on TypeScript?\n\n8:35\n\n* I have heard you guys say good things about Digital Ocean before, but am reading a lot of bad reviews about them on various websites. Are these just frustrated developers or is there any merit to these claims?\n\n12:48\n\n* If you were to build an eCommerce store, given that your business requirements specify that custom functionality is needed, would it be smart to roll your own solution or use Magento/Shopify/Woocommerce? If the later, what is the developer experience like? Which has the greater ability to implement custom functionality for server and client side code?\n\n19:50\n\n* I feel like I’m pretty \"bos\" at starting projects but so terrible at finishing them.

What is the folder structure you use for both your projects and other documents/videos and stuff?\n\n31:38\n\n* You guys mention working for \"agencies\" in the past. As a freelance web developer, what\'s the best way to find these agencies, and to be employed by them? Also, can you explain what \"agencies\" are? \n\n38:14\n\n* I once read an interview Wes gave in which he mentioned that frequently changing jobs is the best way to get salary increases. Do you both believe that to be true? Is job-hopping a bad thing? Is the criticism of it justified? \n\n41:53\n\n* If I choose to use Next.js, does that mean I won’t be able to use new React features like hooks and suspense until/if the Next.js team implements those? \n\n43:12\n\n* When do you use `<React.Fragment>` and when do you use `<div>` to wrap your many returned components from `render()`?\n\n## Links\n* [Devon Govett tweet about Typescript](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1069317990435311617)\n* [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com)\n* [Magento](https://magento.com/)\n* [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)\n* [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)\n* [Reaction Commerce](https://www.reactioncommerce.com)\n* [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n* [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n* [True Grit Texture Supply](https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n\n* Scott: [Undertale](https://undertale.com/)\n* Wes: [Ghostly Pixels](https://ghostlypixels.com)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n\n* [Scott\'s Level Up Pro](https://LevelUpTutorials.com/pro)\n* [Wes\' YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/wesbos)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', 'ad091e64e7476b0cc435d5ac65dc751931799c9e3ce14da555ed3c031919dc69', 'potluck-typescript-e-commerce-platforms-job-hopping-working-for-agencies-more', '/shows/102 - Potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:57.096', '2023-10-27 15:57:45.413', 'TASTY'),

If you botch this, you\'ll be dealing with change orders and scope-creep throughout the entire project. Poor planning is why agencies have project managers and why many freelancers hate their clients.\n* Ask lots of questions\n* Get lots of examples\n* Break down each page into functionality\n* Ask about budget\n* Clarify who will be updating the site\n* Do this in person if possible\n\n17:00 - Quote\n\n* Figuring out the quote\n* Break it down into major functional areas that don\'t necessarily depend on each other.\n* Multi-staged quotes are great because if it\'s too expensive, the client knows they can add additional features later in the project.\n* Explain the tech you will use in relation to how it will help their business, or how easy it will be for them to manage.\n* Presenting the quote\n    * List what will be included\n    * List what won\'t be included\n    * Make your quote valid for two weeks\n    * Create a template that looks professional\n        * Our agency had a professional template, printed on heavy paper in an embossed folder with our logo on it.\n    * You don\'t have to go this far, but experience matters. Think Apple. You can quote more if you have a higher perception of quality.\n\n30:20 - Timelines\n\n* Timelines should include hard dates. You should have a \"hard on\" and and \"hard off\".\n* Assume 24-hour turnaround on questions\n* Be generous with your estimates. Under promise, over deliver.\n* Quoting time is a huge skill\n\n35:58 - Contract\n\n* You best have one\n* Spell out what the client is getting (from quote)\n* At the very least, have the client sign your quote\n* Clear communication and a good relationship is extremely important\n* Use online templates, or have a lawyer create something specific\n\n41:09 - Setting Expectations\n\n* Don\'t make yourself available 24/7\n* Establish a professional environment by not being too casual\n* Your choices will set the course for your relationship\n* Don\'t be too quick to reply to email\n* Schedule emails for 10a.m.\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 036: Hasty Treat - Freelancing Hot Tips](https://syntax.fm/show/036/hasty-treat-freelancing-hot-tips)\n* [docracy](https://www.docracy.com/)\n* [Boomerang for Gmail](https://www.boomeranggmail.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n\n* Scott: [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg)\n* Wes: [Food Busker YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/foodbusker)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n\n* [Scott\'s Level 1 Styled Components Course](https://LevelUpTutorials.com/pro)\n* [Wes\' Courses](https://www.wesbos.com/courses)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'b75eb03ff8a5c1b94b6fefbc9c478c4b31fd62692a104e690aa2e4589f90e132', 'the-freelance-client-lifecycle-part-1', '/shows/112 - freelance.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:57.484', '2023-10-27 15:57:45.860', 'TASTY'),

Otherwise, it\'s just a pretty picture and and the client only thinks about it in terms of taste. Remember, you are the expert they hired, so it\'s not totally subjective—you have the expertise and you need to flex that.\n    * This button is teal because it\'s your call to action—this is the button that makes you money so we want to highlight that\n    * Grey text on white background is hard to read—you\'ll be leaving people out if you do this.\n    * When possible, draw circles or golden ratio lines around everything ;)\n* Be prepared for non-standard feedback\n    * E.g. this feels cloudy, can it look more sunny? Please make it pop, etc.\n* Don\'t get offended by feedback on creative work\n    * Clients didn\'t go to art school and don\'t know about good feedback.\n    * Clients will ignore all finished aspects of a design and only focus on the one minor thing that\'s incorrect.\n* Revisions\n\n17:58 - Development\n\n* Clear requirements make development much easier.\n* Sometimes this starts at the same time or in the process of design.\n* Only show dev progress if client is capable of understanding dev process.\n   * Showing a developed site too early can cause clients to worry about visual aspects that aren\'t yet in line with the design.\n   * Showing to early is also a recipe for a feedback list of things you already know.\n* Give regular progress updates, as previously established. Make it happen on a schedule so expectations are set and so you won\'t forget. Stick to your timeline!\n* Clients don\'t care about technical jargon.\n    * Don\'t tell clients about Gatsby/React as much as telling them about the benefits, how fast the site is, etc.\n\n23:48 - Feedback and revisions\n\n* Feedback is done in revisions or rounds.\n* For smaller projects, have your client email (one email) a list of feedback.\n* For larger projects, and more technical clients, use bug tracking software, such as Github issues, Trello, etc.\n* Write down everything, and then have a follow-up call to discuss the feedback.\n\n30:08 - Deployment\n\n* Get your client to pay for domains and hosting.\n* Make sure their old website has everything off of it, or host the website somewhere else.\n* If you\'re moving servers, best to just point the A records at the new server.\n* If changing nameservers for DNS, make sure the client doesn\'t have email or any other apps on that server that will be nuked or broken when moving.\n* Many clients use their server to uploaded PDFs and other files that may still need to be accessible.\n* If you are changing URL structure, you\'ll need to be aware of any redirects.\n* Backup strategies\n* Restoration strategies\n\n40:05 - Handoff\n\n* Create a video detailing how to do each thing\n* Don\'t give more options than they need in the back end.\n* Do in-person training when possible.\n    * Only teach them the things that are important for their day to day usage.\n\n44:28 - Bug fixes and support\n\n* Very common for clients with wrong idea of project guidelines to want to add on at the end of a project.\n* Not about adding new, non-established features.\n* Emergency bugs require an emergency response if they are your fault\n    * Set expectations and be careful what you promise.\n\n48:03 - What to do when things go to shit\n\n* There should be a trail of communication leading up to things going awry.\n* Project is behind.\n* Product is not met with acceptance.\n* Client isn\'t paying.\n* When to fire your client.\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 112: The Freelance Client Lifecycle - Part 1](https://syntax.fm/show/112/the-freelance-client-lifecycle-part-1)\n* [Syntax 088: Pre-launch Checklist](https://syntax.fm/show/088/pre-launch-checklist)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n\n* Scott: [Synology 4 bay NAS DiskStation DS918+](https://amzn.to/2M94YIq)\n* Wes: [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n\n* [Scott\'s Level Up Pro](https://LevelUpTutorials.com/pro)\n* [Wes\' Advanced React Course](https://www.advancedreact.com)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'c3ce0fe2cb4aac799e54817f4fe24aa86121cf0e47aa69871b5104677d268b8b', 'the-freelance-client-lifecycle-part-2', '/shows/114 - freelance part 2.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:57.571', '2023-10-27 15:57:45.938', 'TASTY'),

Demos are simple, but any real application requires harder config.\n  * Gatsby is Easy Peeezy!\n\n11:09 - Data\n\n* Next.js is unopinionated. Like React, it doesn\'t care where your data comes from.\n  * getInitialProps();\n* Gatsby has a number of \"source\" plugins which will pull in data from sources — markdown, WordPress, API, file system. Once you have that data sourced, you can query it with GraphQL.\n\n22:50 - Routing and Creating Pages\n\n* Next.js makes you create a page in a pages directory. You can nest these as deep as you like. If you want to pass query params, you must do so with a `?query=string`. There are several third-party options for getting around this that require a node server.\n* Gatsby allows you to programmatically create pages with their createPage API.\n* For both navigating between pages, they make a Link Component available.\n\n30:49 - Plugins\n\n* In Gatsby, *everything* goes through the Gatsby pipeline. This makes things like image compression, pagination, sass, service workers and many other progressive web app pieces very easy.\n* Gatsby makes building a really good website easy.\n* Gatsby Image is SOOOOO amazing.\n* The scope of Next.js is much smaller. They give you a few things, but you generally bring your own approach for most things\n  * Routing\n  * Linking and prefetching\n  * Dynamic Importing\n\n38:42 - Deploying and Hosting\n\n* Gatsby is just HTML, CSS, and JS at the end of the day, so it can be deployed almost anywhere — Netlify, Github Pages, cheap PHP hosting, etc.\n* Next.js is a Node app. It can be integrated into an existing Express app, or run by itself. Requires a Node server to run it.\n* Next.js has a static generation option, but you\'re better off using Gatsby for that.\n\n44:41 - The verdict?\n\n* Use Next.js for Apps, Gatsby for Websites\n\n## Links\n\n* [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/syntax)\n* [The Armoury](https://thearmoury.com/)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n\n* Scott: [Motion LED Lights](https://amzn.to/2DtVNhO)\n* Wes: [The Dream Podcast](https://www.thedream.fm/)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n\n* [Scott\'s Pro Gatsby 2 Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/store/products/tutorials/lut-dd028)\n* [Wes\' Courses](https://www.wesbos.com/courses)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', 'b47807b0d76ba008a7c3505e3ac375d910a29f1f18590a926d3c9e351b602bf3', 'gatsby-vs-next', '/shows/120 - gatsby-vs-next.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:57.896', '2023-10-27 15:57:46.213', 'TASTY'),

How do you get your data from sites that may not have an API? Web scraping? Any tools you\'d recommend?\n\n11:34\n\n* Q: Do you think React aims toward a world with functional components only or will class based components always play a role?\n\n17:10\n\n* Q: Just feedback on the recent Smart Home podcast...I really enjoyed it! I have about 48 (color) HUE lights throughout my home, and use an IFTTT applet for my Ring PRO doorbell, so when someone rings the doorbell, all the lights in the home blink (e.g. so I can see when an Amazon Prime package arrives, or know someone is at the front door, etc...while I\'m working and wearing my Bose QC35II\'s, and of course listening to your podcast)! I\'m a huge fan of the podcast since early last summer (I rarely comment, but you guys are great)!\n\n21:37\n\n* Q: What would you do in the event your clients sends you a “thank you” card along with cash that is MUCH lower than you are preparing to invoice them? Would you remove it from the invoice, ask them what they would prefer, etc? I’m stuck in an awkward situation and it doesn’t even cover the hosting costs.\n\n24:39\n\n* Q: I\'ve heard a lot of good things about Next.js, but what exactly is it? How does it compare to just using the create-react-app? Is it worth it to migrate a small side project that I have to Next.js?\n\n28:26\n\n* Q: I take tutorials all the time for web dev. I have taken many of both of your courses. Thank you, they are great! I am completely self taught and have zero computer science education whatsoever. As well as your courses and other tutorials have taught me various languages and libraries, they do not prepare me for real work interviews or jobs. No offense. How do I make the jump from tutorials to real life?\n\n34:39\n\n* Q: Do you have exercises to warm up your brain before you start coding? I always find it a bit difficult to jump straight into a project. I would never start working out before warming up and I feel that\'s also true about development!\n\n36:42\n\n* Q: How should developers deal with depression and mental health?\n\n## Links\n\n* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)\n* [Freshbooks](https://freshbooks.com/syntax)\n* [Syntax 060: The Undocumented Wed](https://syntax.fm/show/060/the-undocumented-web-scraping-private-apis-proxies-and-alternative-solutions)\n* [Syntax 118: The Smart Home](https://syntax.fm/show/118/the-smart-home)\n* [IFTTT Hue/Ring applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/352303p)\n* [Syntax 120: Gatsby vs Next](https://syntax.fm/show/120/gatsby-vs-next)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n\n* Scott: [Clarity Money](https://claritymoney.com/)\n* Wes: [Wyze Camera](https://amzn.to/2Xl4xQs)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n\n* [Scott\'s React Hooks For Everyone](https://LevelUpTutorials.com/pro)\n* [Wes\' CSS Grid Course](https://cssgrid.io/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'ad4b20d8a0caf759c5c4004e32008da1b93c342a5739eaa6cca11d3d4ab0f038', 'potluck-are-classes-dead-tutorials-vs-real-life-cra-vs-next-scraping-more', '/shows/124 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:58.078', '2023-10-27 15:57:46.394', 'TASTY'),

Be warned! \n\n3:59 - The problem we have with React right now\n\n  * API calls\n  * Image loading\n  * Code splitting\n\n7:16 - What is React Suspense?\n\n1. First we convert our async data fetching functions into **resources**\n2. Resources can then be read inside render - above the return\n3. Resources can be read from cache\n4. Resources can be preloaded into a cache if you anticipate needing them\n5. Resources reads are blocking for that function - you can\'t return JSX until the resource is read\n6. In your component that fetches data, there is no need to maintain a loading state\n7. Then, anywhere higher up in that tree, you can introduce a suspense component\n8. The suspense component can **detect** if any of it\'s children are currently loading data\n9. If they are, we can then choose to show a loader via the **fallback** prop\n10. We can also choose to **show nothing via the maxDelay prop** — this is helpful for fast connections that shouldn\'t see the spinner for a short split-second\n\n15:20 - Support\n\n* React.lazy and suspense for code splitting is already here\n* The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component\n* Loadable Components is recommended if you need splitting with SSR\n* Data Resources is not here yet\n\n## Links\n* [React 16.x Roadmap](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html#react-16x-mid-2019-the-one-with-suspense-for-data-fetching)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '63b205383b7514f6dc5918f6264d7f2c2adeb53b631b60240d23b3b322505958', 'hasty-treat-react-suspense', '/shows/127 - react suspense.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:58.225', '2023-10-27 15:57:46.562', 'HASTY'),

I am comfortable with media queries but find often times the design is very different between sizes. It is easy to tame the complexity of repeated data for the different component views keeping everything in sync but is it good practice to put two completely different component level views in a single HTML file? Does the repeated data in the static HTML have any effect on SEO?\n\n7:08\n\n* Q: How should a mid developer know when its time to leave the current company? Is tech stack (e.g frameworkless) a decent reason even though he/she is happy at the place, but feels like they are not growing enough?\n\n11:19\n\n* Q: Should I worry about the critical vulnerabilities when installing an NPM package?\n\n14:40\n\nI specifically use an external NPM package called [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) and then I just run `ncu`...\n\n15:06\n\n* Q: I\'ve had the idea for styling one site two different ways (professional/artistic) and giving visitors a button to toggle between the two. Too gimmicky? Secondary: how did you pick your brand colors?\n\n20:19\n\n* Q: Any SICK TIPS on career change? I\'m a full-time employee with two kids and a lovely wife, who wants a fulfilling career. I throw as much time in as I can to study, but I feel like it isn\'t enough to apply for jobs.\n\n24:01\n\n* Q: Within the next two years, how well do you think WebVR and WebXR technologies would fit within mainstream web development (think A-Frame, SparkAR, React 360 in normal websites and applications)?\n\n30:39\n\n* Q: Should I learn Fullstack JS or JAMstack for freelancing?\n\n35:34\n\n* Q: Is front-end development dying?\n\n37:30\n\n* Q: How do you deal with CSS-in-JS when you have one-off stuff, or coupled components/selectors like a [CSS] grid container and a grid child (think `grid-area`)? CSS-in-JS feels very verbose for this use case.\n\n42:07\n\n* Q: Scott always talks about Meteor. I thinks its really cool too. What\'s the future of it and why didn\'t it take off? It seems to have slowed down. They seem to have moved on to other projects like GraphQL stuff.\n\n## Links\n* [Influx](https://www.influxtechnology.com/)\n* [WebVR](https://webvr.info/)\n* [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/)\n* [Google Maps will use a core Waze feature to improve public transit](https://news.yahoo.com/google-maps-core-waze-feature-223508153.html)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [The Making of a Manager](https://amzn.to/2Dq9WNG)\n* Wes: [DeWalt Oscillating Tool](https://amzn.to/2Iz7jNQ)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Wes: [Wes\' Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses) — use coupon code \"syntax\" at checkout and get and extra $10 off.\n* Scott: [Animating React](https://leveluptutorials.com/pro)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '35e91f806b149bb7417c28968045a3ee0060f40344d42c1e2b4a9348209d0df1', 'potluck-media-queries-npm-vulnerabilities-fullstack-js-vs-jamstack-web-vr-ar-switching-jobs-more', '/shows/140 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:58.750', '2023-10-27 15:57:47.164', 'TASTY'),

What is the most efficient way to store these items and deliver them to the browser? Would you use state, a JSON object, a MongoDB document or some other way I haven\'t thought of? \n\n7:17 - Q: How much do I need to know before I start applying for dev jobs?\n\n9:26 - Q: Do you folks have any opinions on Skeleton loaders, and any thoughts on how best to implement them? At my day job we\'ve recently implemented skeleton loaders in a way that inherits the parent styles. Would love to know if there\'s any best practices for this or ways we can improve our setup.\n\n13:01 - Q: Do you think we still need to use CSS resets like normalize and sanitizer?\n\n14:56 - Q: Scott, can you tell the story of how you landed an interview for a job in Japan? I am moving to Japan next year and wondering how that opportunity arose for you.\n\n20:04 - Q: Do you guys have an opinion on angular good or bad? Or is it that you\'re more comfortable and have used React and Vue more often, so they\'re largely at the center of any framework discussions?\n\n22:54 - Q: Could you talk about naming and structuring files/folders in your applications? How do you name components and folders? Do you follow some sort of path of how to structure files in a web app?\n\n29:01 - Q: Do you think that Node is almost too powerful to handle some of the simpler tasks (a site that just needs a contact form for instance), or am I just missing some very simple configuration? It seems like other languages, such as PHP, might be better suited for some of these simple tasks and Node is really just meant for larger scale application? I guess what my question really boils down to is, for a freelancer, I understand that I need to have my hands in a lot of different tech stacks, but should I really dive in on PHP (or something else) to handle some of these simpler features a client might need?\n\n33:24 - Q: What do you guys think about Svelte? Before everything goes WASM will Svelte be the future of web programming?\n\n37:24 - Q: What smart phones and laptops do you use for work? (specific model and why)\n\n42:38 - Q: Should I apply for other jobs even if my contract might get renewed? Should I feel loyal to a company?\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [DaVinci Resolve 16](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)\n* Wes: [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Wes: [Wes\' Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses) — use coupon code \"syntax\" at checkout and get and extra $10 off.\n* Scott: [Scott\'s Crouses](https://leveluptutorials.com/pro)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'f77a9775082fb4895480b27f6df75f08beea7995273b710990bedc2e99b62ecf', 'potluck-css-angular-dev-job-preparation-svelte-file-organization-gear-more', '/shows/148 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:59.083', '2023-10-27 15:57:47.760', 'TASTY'),

Any tips on achieving my goals to make me happy, but also keep my family happy?\n\n10:10 - Q: What is your advice to very junior/junior devs in writing cover letters for jobs? I wonder what to say without sounding canned and fake.\n\n14:35 - Q: Scott, what was the stack you were using at Ford?	\n\n17:09 - Q: Other than reading the docs, how do you guys go about learning/trying out new technologies? Do you rebuild similar applications or pick out individual features you think are \"sIcK\"?\n\n22:32 - Q: Is it always necessary to use setState in react when storing data (for example, a form input) even if you don\'t intend on re-rendering the page, or can you get away without using state?	\n\n25:04 - Q: Development has a stereotype for being a young person\'s game. As someone who started their career out of university, I often wonder how long I can sling divs for? Do you think you could make it to retirement age or do you think the game will change out from under you?\n\n30:34 - Q: Scott, you\'ve mentioned you love hip hop. Would you be willing to share any playlists of your all-time favorite hip hop artists?\n\n32:08 - Q: What are your thoughts on HTML pre-processors? If you use one, which one(s) do you prefer and why?\n\n36:04 - Q: What advice would you have for someone considering to \"level up\" their career by moving from a city with few tech jobs to a city with more opportunity for tech jobs? What are some of the biggest things to consider when moving possibly cross-country to further a career?	\n\n42:11 - Q: What are your recommendations in terms of resources for first time dads (and moms) like books, podcasts, etc. and generally good co-parenting advice for working professionals?\n\n46:45 - Q: Loved the show with Travis. Had a question about “the gap”. Similar to design ambitions/taste surpassing current skill, when did you feel like your code had “grown up” and that you could actually DO what you envisioned with Javascript? \n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 044: How to Learn New Things Quickly](https://syntax.fm/show/044/how-to-learn-new-things-quickly)\n* [Scott\'s Spotify playlist - \"Rap Music To Code To = Level Up Tutorials\"](https://open.spotify.com/user/torartc/playlist/71NVDjvoMRJ6wfmJuN9iNU?si=7qADFqdxSPGdEq93IY368A)\n* [Scott\'s Spotify playlist - \"Golden Era\"](https://open.spotify.com/user/torartc/playlist/42tTDR1B1NbAWihMnxEQ6n?si=EVuF8_h0QlOyiJ1nHHj1mA)\n* [Scott\'s music picks](https://twitter.com/stolinski/status/1129447040931340288)\n* [Apache - Apache Ain\'t Shit](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XuS5DIjel4dghKgwtYNtt?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [MF DOOM - MM...Food](https://open.spotify.com/album/7IvmRtuLsTlRZhRS6KUQRn?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly](https://open.spotify.com/album/7ycBtnsMtyVbbwTfJwRjSP?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [GZA - Liquid Swords](https://open.spotify.com/album/3k8xoyOXkGgZxUKgpmxz4P?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Gang Starr - Daily Operation](https://open.spotify.com/album/74DwNAuirHLDLVLrBQAnVg?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Slick Rick - The Ruler\'s Back](https://open.spotify.com/album/5UWKXx7GvU5YhXx0OBNnhD?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Redman & Method Man - Blackout](https://open.spotify.com/album/5K9kD50P66neofCR8BoYxg?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Q-Tip - The Renaissance](https://open.spotify.com/album/3asZSLOAAtCNJz5W2LGuFJ?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)[Expanded Edition] - Wu-Tang Clan](https://open.spotify.com/album/3tQd5mwBtVyxCoEo4htGAV?autoplay=true&v=L)\n* [Pete Rock on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3BeQqzKdlARoOd6y30kCO2)\n* [Preemo on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Kr4V7oQfFb1rB2nzXKTTb)\n* [Codeland Conference](https://codelandconf.com/)\n* [Syntax 142: Travis Neilson on Skills Gap, Design, Focus and Working at Google](https://syntax.fm/show/142/travis-neilson-on-skills-gap-design-focus-and-working-at-google)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset](https://amzn.to/2EPWTGd)\n* Wes: [Marpac Rhom Portable White Noise Sound Machine](https://amzn.to/2MrmknB)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* [Scott\'s new course - \"Dev Tools and Debugging\"](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro)\n* [Wes\' Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'beb0a59da6042359d7aed981d996ed5bab2b9e7b71b827a576e58b587602689b', 'potluck-career-switch-at-33-cover-letters-kids-learning-quickly-more', '/shows/156 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:59.400', '2023-10-27 15:57:48.386', 'TASTY'),

And while I understand a little about it, I never understand it in the context you both use it. Can you enlighten us?\n\n6:52 - Q: I have an idea for a project that is suited for web sockets, push text/images/documents to a bunch of users in real time. I just learned about Firebase\'s real-time database, and it looks like it would be pretty easy to implement my idea. What are your thoughts, pros/cons, of these two technologies?\n\n10:42 - Q: How\'s your fitness going?\n\n12:15 - Q: Let\'s say both of you gents were junior developers that had basic knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript but you had all the experience and knowledge of how to best master those skills and where the industry was heading. What would be the outline and focus of your road-map knowing what you do now?\n\n17:22 - Q: Is it worth it to find a remote dev job at an early stage of your career? Considering the stuff I learn from my seniors and other devs on the team, I wonder if I will lose the opportunity to learn stuff from my team members?\n\n19:49 - Q: How do I keep myself motivated in coding?\n\n22:47 - Q: What\'s y\'all\'s opinion on using some obscure (at least in my opinion) features of a language, such as Javascript bitwise operators, in a production app that dozens of other engineers maintain, and will continue to maintain long after you leave the company? It seems hard to read and immediately understand, which possibly makes it harder to debug/refactor in the future. Is it the responsibility of future devs to learn if they don\'t know, or should you find a different way to code the solution in the first place?\n\n26:00 - Q: Wes, I keep hearing you talk about working from your Dropbox. Do you sync up everything? Even things like your node module folders?\n\n29:26 - Q: Have you talked about Firefox Developer Edition? It looks like it should be very useful, but I can\'t quite make the transition.\n\n32:58 - Q: Hey guys, what your opinion of CSS naming convention methodologies such as BEM?\n\n35:04 - Q: I would like to refer to the question from ep 140 about fronted development possibly dying. I don\'t feel satisfied with the answer, so maybe I could state the question differently: With the machine learning being developed rapidly in recent years, will the web change, causing reduction of front-end jobs? Maybe we will just be training smart algorithms and developing them instead? What do you think?\n\n40:32 - Q: How do you deal with anxiety and fear during interviews that might hinder your ability to give the best impression of yourself or solve coding challenges?\n\n## Links\n* [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/)\n* [Syntax 020: Fitness, Nutrition, and Losing Weight](https://syntax.fm/show/020/fitness-nutrition-and-losing-weight)\n* [Syntax 084: Fitness for Developers](https://syntax.fm/show/084/fitness-for-developers)\n* [Syntax 164: A Story About Kanye West and Learning to Code](https://syntax.fm/show/164/a-story-about-kanye-west-and-learning-to-code)\n* [Syntax 140: Potluck - Media Queries × NPM Vulnerabilities × Fullstack JS vs JAMstack × Web VR/AR × Switching Jobs × More!](https://syntax.fm/show/140/potluck-media-queries-npm-vulnerabilities-fullstack-js-vs-jamstack-web-vr-ar-switching-jobs-more)\n* [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/)\n* [Slack](https://slack.com/)\n* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n* [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup-b.html)\n* [FireFox developer edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)\n* [Brave](https://brave.com/)\n* [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)\n* [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)\n* [How you can train an AI to convert your design mockups into HTML and CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-you-can-train-an-ai-to-convert-your-design-mockups-into-html-and-css-cc7afd82fed4/)\n* [How AI And Machine Learning Are Transforming Front-End Development?](https://medium.com/@Jessicawlm/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-transforming-front-end-development-db74523fd46b)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Wyze Sense](https://www.wyze.com/wyze-sense/)\n* Wes: [Arthur on CBC kids](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ELpoA-uHf0-f_86wCagoDcsg)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Wes: [CSS Grid Course](https://cssgrid.io/)\n* Scott: [Gatsby Ecommerce Course, and Dev Tools & Debugging Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '29f8ac44b4102e611f40b7dd739581a054503176401a044132c086b9e8d16831', 'potluck-what-is-state-web-sockets-remote-working-firefox-machines-taking-our-jobs-more', '/shows/166 - What is State Potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:06:59.931', '2023-10-27 15:57:48.957', 'TASTY'),

But is grid-area more performant? For example, in Flexbox, it\'s a best practice to use the shorthand flex property instead of writing out flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.\n\n4:04 - Q: Do you have any advice how to deploy an application? What do you think about AWS, Zeit, Heroku, Firebase? Do you use automation tools like Circle CI or Buddy.works? I also wonder if we should keep whole application on one server, or split it up.\n\n9:36 - Q: A career advice question: I\'m best at being a front-end/javascript developer - but in a quest to my make job(s) easier, I\'ve also been getting into fullstack architecture - namely CI/CD (TravisCI, GitlabCI) and Kubernetes. I\'m feeling like I\'m spreading myself a little thin, and I guess I\'m just finding it a bit frustrating (configuring Kubernetes is a lot of bashing your head against the wall). I know that my skills as a front-end developer are already valuable, whereas I can\'t say the same for my Kubernetes/CICD skillset. I\'m wondering whether I should narrow my scope a bit. Maybe this is just the frustrating hump I\'m climbing over, and in six months I\'ll be happy with where I\'m at, but interested to hear your thoughts. One thing I\'ve been thinking about is, maybe I should step back from the network architecture type stuff (ie. Kubernetes) and focus more on DevOps that is closer to the front-end stack (ie. writing tests, VSCode tooling, commit hooks, CI tools, etc.).\n\n13:07 - Q: Do you think Typescript adds value to React, or more complexity than value? When should you choose Typescript for a project?\n\n18:09 - Q: I am in a well known Bootcamp, and as of right now (from what they have taught us) this is what I am working with: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Express, SQL, Auth, MVC, APIs, React, Redux. As we finish off the program, they are going over Java. I do want to learn Java, however I feel like my time would be better spent fine-tuning my knowledge on my stack. And I can learn Java at some other time. Do you recommend that I fully engage with Java and try to absorb some of the basics and fundamentals now, or do you recommend that I take this last month we have here and strengthen my current skills so I do better during my technical interviews? And by the way thanks for everything you do, it helps :)\n\n22:02 - Q: Have you seen the live coding going on at Twitch? Thoughts? Maybe a Syntax stream in the future? There\'s a good list at livecoders.dev. Thanks for all you do. Keep killin\' it!\n\n26:11 - Q: How do you handle people (i.e. C# bastards) who think JavaScript is a joke and is going to be overthrown by Blazor or some other C# library framework? Can\'t we all just get along and live in the same industry? I\'m having a hard time being the adult in these kinds of responses around the web, and in random discussions with people I know very well.\n\n29:55 - Q: There are plenty of places saying that it is important to secure API keys by not embedding them in front-end code. Cool. I\'m on board! But there is not many that tell you specifically how to do this. How do you safely use an API key in a CRUD project?\n\n34:15 - Q: Do you plan to launch a Syntax.fm app?\n\n45:49 - Q: I was hired as a junior developer at a company in the last year. It\'s my first development job and I was so excited. The interview and application were all about React and fullstack development. However now that I\'ve been here a while, I have found out the company does primarily dev ops work. None of this was mentioned in the interview or application, but it looks like soon it will be the majority of my workload. I am feeling very discouraged and was wondering what you guys would do in this situation?\n\n## Links\n* [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/)\n* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n* [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)\n* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)\n* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)\n* [Buddy.works](https://buddy.works/)\n* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)\n* [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/)\n* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)\n* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n* [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)\n* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [VIVO Premium Heavy Duty Arm](https://amzn.to/31DHdyJ)\n* Wes: [AmazonBasics Pro-Style Spring Sprayer Kitchen Faucet, Oil-Rubbed Bronze](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Pro-Style-Spring-Sprayer-Kitchen/dp/B07F2R728S)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [LevelUpTutorials Pro - Gatsby Ecommerce](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro)\n* Wes: [All Courses - Beginner JS Course](https://wesbos.com/courses/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '8d57c45f5c7f1ff99e44d36bb12a949a711af066284998ee730448dd5c654bf7', 'potluck-deploying-applications-typescript-live-coding-with-twitch-fullstack-architecture-more', '/shows/172 - Potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:00.179', '2023-10-27 15:57:49.254', 'TASTY'),

How much work is a good amount of work to transition into freelancing full-time?\n\n9:52 - Q: How much flexbox is too much flexbox? Is it a bad idea to use a dozen flexboxes for a viewport-filling application?\n\n13:19 - Q: Can you explain the \"potential\" benefit of resetting CSS and whether it\'s necessary? In which circumstances should we use such an approach?\n\n15:26 - Q: I would love to hear an episode, or potluck segment, about your shell/fish/zsh configs. Maybe explain little tweaks you\'ve made and why you\'ve chosen the shell you use.\n\n23:26 - Q: I always get confused on when and how to use .bind() method. Any pointers on when I should use .bind(), like in what situations? I also see it used a lot in React apps, but have no idea why they are using it. Could you explain this in detail?\n\n27:02 - What are your suggestions for handing off client sites for freelance work? I don\'t take many contracts (I have another full time job) but I\'ll take one here or there during summer to supplement a little bit. I\'m finding it difficult to make a clean hand-off when the project is finished. The contractual requirements are met and like anything, there are always tweaks to be made. I\'ll handle some minor deployment issues without billing, but I struggle with where to draw the line. What suggestions do you have? \n\n35:19 - This question is for Wes. I live in Central New York, and every time I go on the highway heading north or south I see several Ontario license plates. Where are ya\'ll going all the time? Is there a secret Canadian spot down here? \n\n38:20 - Each time I re-open an old project I lose so much time with npm dependencies being outdated and it drives me mad! I\'m starting to dislike npm and everything around it, but is it npm only? How does other languages like php, python or GO handle this mess of dependencies? Are we better today than yesterday and I\'m just complaining about nothing?\n\n43:50 - Which podcast player do you use (Android, PC, or other phone/tablet), and why?

If not, what dynamic content would prevent you from doing so?\n\n10:48 - Q: What\'s the difference between a software developer and a software engineer, in your opinion?\n\n13:11 - Q: How do you deal with designers who design without any thought about how dev will implement it?\n\n15:46 - Q: I saw that Wes has an example in one of his slides where the Array prototype is written onto the Nodelist prototype. Is this safe enough for production as it overrides all regular NodeList behavior? \n\n19:18 - Q: In a potluck episode you mentioned that you do not host your clients\' website. If you don’t host you clients\' website how do you usually go about handling clients that are less tech savvy? Or do you avoid those types of clients?\n\n21:30 - Q: I know you guys (especially Wes) have been pretty insistent recently on not hosting clients\' sites yourself, but what do you guys think about continuously hosting client sites with a service like Netlify? It\'s highly unlikely to go down and scales all for you, so it might be a bit of reoccurring income if you bill them yearly for the minimal Netlify fees.\n\n24:44 - Q: I was listening to your episode on \"The Smart Home\" and I\'m very interested in buying a Google Home Mini myself. However, I cannot stop thinking about the privacy implications of an always listening device around the house. What are your thoughts on this topic and on privacy related to online services in general?\n\n29:08 - Q: What are your thoughts about using a CMS that uses flat files vs one that uses a traditional MySQL or Postgres database for a company blog that won\'t have insane traffic? We\'re currently evaluating Grav CMS and Craft CMS.\n\n32:17 - Q: Have you used data attributes as custom elements in CSS and JS?\n\n37:32 - Q: Why do so many people jump on styled-components/CSS in JS? Are these all people who have never used Sass/SCSS?! It seems like such a PITA to get Sass working with either of these. It feels like coding tables vs HTML 5. To me it seems like a step backwards.\n\n44:26 - Q: When do you, if ever, reach for a component library, like Material or Bootstrap? Currently working a corporate job where it’s almost expected to use one of these for all internal applications. I usually prefer to make my own, but I’m wondering if I’m just making my life more difficult than it needs to be? Any advice?\n\n48:30 - Q: Could you guys chat about Git clients and which ones you guys use and why? Or are you guys hardcore terminal geeks?\n\n## Links\n* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n* [Bling.js](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/12fb951a8b893a454b32)\n* [Syntax 118: The Smart Home](https://syntax.fm/show/118/the-smart-home)\n* [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/)\n* [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/)\n* [prismic](https://prismic.io/)\n* [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)\n* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)\n* [Tina CMS](https://tinacms.org/)\n* [Forestry](https://forestry.io/)\n* [Airdale Chemical](http://www.airedalechemical.com/)\n* [Material](https://material.io/)\n* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [HeavySet - Gym Workout Log](https://www.runloop.com/heavyset-gym-workout-log-for-iphone)\n* Wes: [Baroness Von Sketch](https://www.cbc.ca/baroness/m_site/)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [FullStack React with NextJS](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript Course](https://www.beginnerjavascript.com/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', 'a5d55d1bcc609e16e2fefe3bea347b04c67447311fd4fb96669e116cd2e02f15', 'potluck-gatsby-vs-next-is-google-home-spying-on-you-flat-file-cms-css-frameworks-hosting-client-sites-more', '/shows/194 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:01.188', '2023-10-27 15:57:50.489', 'TASTY'),

If you\'ve seen a problem before, it\'s easier to solve.\n\n10:00 - Look at the end game\n\n* What are you really trying to do here? Don\'t focus so much on the tech that you miss the bigger picture. \n\n13:17 - Read Again\n\n* Error logs provide the best clues. Read them closely.\n* Actually read your code — don\'t skim it.\n* Write comments while reading it, or follow existing comments — good for documenting, but also for structuring your thoughts.\n\n18:08 - Make it simple (break it into smaller parts)\n\n* Limit the number of inputs and outputs\n* Get it working in a limited capacity (e.g. safe mode, Codepen, etc.)\n* Comment out major sections of code until you have a working example\n* Does this problem exist outside of the framework?\n* Does this work in a clean environment?\n\n25:35 - Take yourself out of your environment\n\n* You should be able to take a look at the problem at all zoom levels\n* Does it work locally but not on the server?\n* Does it work in other browsers?\n\n27:32 - Stay calm\n\n* It\'s easy to get nervous or worked up when the stakes are high\n* It won\'t serve you to panic. If you are panicking, take a 10 min walk to deep breath\n* Take a shower, lift weights (seriously)\n\n30:14 - Talk it over\n\n* Getting the perspective of another developer can be invaluable\n\n32:28 - Make things obvious\n\n* Use debugger or label logs — don\'t let it be ambiguous\n* For CSS bugs, use primary colors to make things stand out\n* Use the right tool to make the problem stand out\n  * Layers for CSS issues\n  * Network for network issues\n  * Performance tab (etc.)\n\n35:12 - Use Git correctly to free up your techniques\n\n* If you\'re code commits are up to date, you can heavily modify code without fear of deleting things — just revert to a previous commit once you find the issue and fix.\n\n36:10 - Don\'t jump at solutions\n\n* Take the time to fully dissect the problem\n* Question you assumptions\n* It can\'t possibly be a problem with ____. Well maybe it is.\n  * Wes once spent hours trying to diagnose a check engine light when the gas cap was lose.\n\n43:51 - Get good at pattern matching\n\n* This comes with experience\n* When did this problem start? \n* Did we deploy any code? Did we change any logic? \n\n44:54 - Get good at googling\n\n* Being able to describe your problem is key.\n* Search the error from Firefox\n\n## Links\n* [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)\n* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)\n* [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/syntax)\n* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)\n* [Syntax 154: SVGs with Sara Soueidan](https://syntax.fm/show/154/svgs-with-sara-soueidan)\n* [@walpolea](https://twitter.com/walpolea)\n* [Syntax 152: Debugging Tools + Tips](https://syntax.fm/show/152/debugging-tools-tips)\n* [@bowlendev](https://twitter.com/bowlendev)\n* [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov)\n* [Ryan Dahl on creating Node.js](https://youtu.be/EeYvFl7li9E)\n* [@LaurieonTech](https://twitter.com/LaurieonTech)\n* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/)\n* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Jeremy Ethier Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCERm5yFZ1SptUEU4wZ2vJvw)\n* Wes: [Marpac Rohm Sound Machine](https://amzn.to/2Ncp1rw)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Typescript in React Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript Course](https://beginnerjavascript.com)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '3d89db88d923fa4b94c4592801834d337ffca0db1efc0e7c9af21256df45b2ff', 'how-to-get-better-at-problem-solving', '/shows/198 - problem solving.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:01.414', '2023-10-27 15:57:50.680', 'TASTY'),

But I am scared that, even though I will continue to stay on the cutting edge in my personal projects, using Angular in my job will make it harder to get a job after that in more modern tech like React. Do you think there is any truth to this?\n\n5:30 - Q: Yo guys, saw soy sauce stirred up quite the controversy...lol. What are some big developer disagreements you guys have?\n\n11:40 - Q: In JavaScript, ! == is the same as ! =, but I was told there was a slight technical difference. I cannot find what the difference is. Could you elaborate on this?\n\n14:17 - Q: What are the rules on using another dev\'s repos as a boiler plate? Example: Using Wes\'s advanced react starter files to utilize his set up for my own project? \n\n15:35 - Q: What music do you listen to while you code? As an extension, could we crowd source a dev playlist and host it on Spotify?\n\n20:26 - Q: How do you go about working with different technologies and stacks (front-end related) when you have to accommodate for the client or other developers\' biases towards specific things. For example, you have to learn a different set of tools because in a new project someone doesn\'t like what you use and says X is a better tool for the job.\n\n23:11 - Q: I know there is no magic SEO silver bullet, but what are some best practices for implementing SEO into your website or web application?\n\n27:26 - Q: When dealing with responsive sites, how do you go about respecting the request in iOS safari to show desktop sites?\n\n28:45 - Q: I get confused about your usage of the word \'app\'. You don\'t make iPhone or Android apps, but you often through the word around like \"I would create a Node App\", or \"Some of the apps I made\" etc. Is it just website applications, or how exactly should I interpret \"Node App\" or \"Web App\" compared to a mobile app?\n\n31:36 - Q: I wanted to ask your thoughts on transform class properties plugin from Babel? Heard the podcast on react state, I found it mind blowing when setting everything up without constructors.\n\n36:53 - Q: I am a beginner, I have mostly learned front-end so far (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React). Should I first get pretty good at these before I start learning some back-end?

Or have you found an app or hack to run the audit over the entire site / multiple pages?\n\n5:30 - Q: What makes a font \"good\"? I stumbled upon [haleyfiege.fun/fonts](https://www.haleyfiege.fun/fonts), where she says her first font was not \"good,\" but it looks perfectly usable to me. When you are picking fonts for web apps, how do you judge them? Is it entirely subjective?\n\n9:14 - Q: As a solo founder, speed is essential. What\'s faster, building your own components, using a theme, or using a framework?\n\n12:05 - Q: I’ve never been a tea drinker, but lately I’ve been wanting to start drinking a hot tea in the afternoon (instead of coffee). I know Scott is the Tea Guru, so what would your suggestions be for starting out?\n\n15:30 - Q: Is it worth bundling JavaScript for websites that aren\'t using a framework (i.e. WordPress / CMS websites)? The company I work for uses a large enterprise CMS and our JavaScript is just a minified mash of several different JS files, most of which are several hundred lines of spaghetti code. It would be nice to break up all these files in some sort of modular way, plus have the added benefit of using Babel so we can write modern JS. However, the output of the bundled JS file seems massive. Won\'t that hurt performance and page load?\n\n21:17 - Q: I know both of you put out a ton of content, both together and individually. I’m just curious to hear if you listen to any other podcasts out there in the land, or any other types of content that you consume to hone your skillz to pay the billz. Thanks!\n\n25:14 - Q: What are your thoughts on Blazor? Is it a good move to be an early adopter of a framework like this, or should you focus on the ones that are already in a fully released state like React, Vue etc.?\n\n28:51 - Q: I would like to ask Scott how you make subscriptions in a website? Also, how you give users a lifetime locked yearly subscription?\n\n39:53 - Q: I feel like other developers\' code is always shorter, better structured, and easier to read than mine. Any tips (or resources) on writing clean, \'good\' javascript code (or any other functional programming language)?\n\n44:02 - Q: Both of you have CMS backgrounds, Scott with Drupal and Wes with WordPress. When you moved to freelancing, did you build for clients using a CMS? Or did you create custom admin interfaces for clients to manage their own site? You\'ve mentioned some headless WordPress in the past, but was that the norm?\n\n47:02 - Q: Hey Scott + Wes, you\'re obviously very successful with your course creation careers, but do you miss client work? If people for some reason ever stopped buying your courses, would you go back to client work?\n\n## Links\n* [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)\n* [Syntax203: Hasty Treat - What Are Github Actions?](https://syntax.fm/show/203/hasty-treat-what-are-github-actions)\n* [Lighthouse Batch NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse-batch)\n* [Lighthouse Action GitHub Action](https://github.com/jakejarvis/lighthouse-action)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n* [haleyfiege.fun/fonts](https://www.haleyfiege.fun/fonts)\n* [Radnika Next](https://hanken.co/products/radnika-next)\n* [Sipsby](https://www.sipsby.com/)\n* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n* [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/)\n* [CodePen Radio](https://blog.codepen.io/radio/)\n* [Heist Podcast](https://www.heistpodcast.com/)\n* [Mixergy](https://mixergy.com/)\n* [The Dream](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dream/id1435743296)\n* [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/)\n* [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast)\n* [Akimbo](https://www.akimbo.link/)\n* [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)\n* [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)\n* [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/)\n* [Syntax055: Hasty Treat - User Role Systems](https://syntax.fm/show/055/hasty-treat-user-role-systems)\n* [Clean Code concepts adapted for JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)\n* [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)\n* [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/)\n* [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/)\n* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)\n* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Aerial America](https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/aerial-america/701)\n* Wes: [Streamer for Chromecast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streamer-for-chromecast/id1151425002)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Level Up Tutorials Pro](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', 'ce84a222ee79038d5b8ca5f36f6837262f2a6a596a20cdf00c9855fd5647c710', 'potluck-fonts-frameworks-teas-coding-subscriptions-client-work-more', '/shows/210 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:01.976', '2023-10-27 15:57:51.317', 'TASTY'),

But after the first week, I really hate it. I feel like I don\'t fit in and I\'m seeing many red flags. There are no processes and there doesn\'t seem to be any real excitement around what we are building. What should I do? Do I suck it up for a while? Or do I start looking for something else, potentially taking a pay cut (and moving back into doing web dev as opposed to building apps) to work at another creative agency with people who are more my jam?\n\n10:32 - Does Syntax have a Discord or Slack community channel to collaborate on topics?\n\n12:00 - What is one thing that *really* annoys you about Javascript? I\'m curious if you could change one thing about the language itself, what would it be?\n\n15:08 - Have you tried Fauna DB?\n\n19:13 - What are your thoughts on including tutorial projects in a portfolio? (For example, putting the Sick Fits site from Wes\' Advanced React course in a portfolio.) I\'m relatively new to React and have a couple of my own projects, but a bunch of projects from following a course.\n\n23:58 - A site you\'re maintaining is hacked, how do you handle fixing it?\n\n30:28 - My bookmarks are overwhelming! I just started learning web dev and even though I sort my bookmarks into folders, I end up with so much that I don’t even know how to use them. What do you guys do for managing bookmarks on browsers?\n\n34:15 - How would you recommend integrating React and other modern JS frameworks into (more or less) \"static\" or \"brochure\" websites? Say for instance I have a banking website that has mostly static content, but also has complicated JS pieces such as calculators, location finders and sign-up forms? I currently reach for jQuery & jQuery plugins for these pieces of functionality, but React and Vue sound like they could also help solve these one-off pieces of functionality. Most tutorials and examples are based on creating apps from the ground up, but what if you only want to sprinkle these frameworks in and only use them where JS is necessary? How might the both of you solve for these scenarios?\n\n38:00 - I was wondering whether you could share which backpack, or bag do you use for carrying your laptops? I\'m looking for something that would be useful for carrying my 16\" Macbook Pro, but also could hold some other stuff like groceries, clothes, or other various things that one may want to put there.\n\n41:50 - Do you write out a vanilla `fetch()` in your components that need it, or do you use a fetch \"wrapper\" written by yourself or someone else? If so, what does it look like?\n\n46:16 - Have you ever done any automation projects using a Raspberry Pi? I am trying my hand at remote access to the solar power setup at our \'bach\' (pronounced \'batch\') here in New Zealand, which is the same thing as a \'cottage\' in Canada. Finding it hard to find good resources for this online as most get really technical really fast. My idea is to take the RS485 modbus data and just send it up to a DB every 5 minutes or so. \n\n51:38 - What do Wes and Scott think about beards and have you ever thought about growing one?\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 215: Hasty Treat - Picking the Stack for uses.tech - Gatsby, React, Context, Styled Components](https://syntax.fm/show/215/hasty-treat-picking-the-stack-for-uses-tech-gatsby-react-context-styled-components)\n* [r/SyntaxFM/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyntaxFM/)\n* [Fauna](https://fauna.com/)\n* [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)\n* [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)\n* [Wes\' Advanced React Course](https://advancedreact.com/)\n* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)\n* [Full Stack Radio 132: Caleb Porzio - Just Enough JavaScript with Alpine.js](http://www.fullstackradio.com/132)\n* [Peak Design Everyday Bag](https://amzn.to/2trxQa8)\n* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)\n* [Extreme ironing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ironing)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Shogun Wheel Yoga Wheel](https://amzn.to/37cWPMT)\n* Wes: [Velcro Cable Ties](https://amzn.to/2REGVEi)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [How To Make a GraphQL Server](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '588dbd55b22570e4bbfef1f0bd046f8015e81ba60e94a7080b31cffed308c9d5', 'potluck-dev-culture-fit-slack-communities-vanilla-js-backpacks-raspberry-pi-more', '/shows/218 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:02.306', '2023-10-27 15:57:51.787', 'TASTY'),

Any recommendations where to start with either Next.js or Gastby.js? How do I check to see if a person is up-to-date with payment?\n\n4:14 - What\'s your favorite new tab page?\n\n6:19: CSS vs SCSS vs Styled Components? When you are developing a React or Next.js application which styling method do you guys use and why? Which one is \"best practice\", or a more efficient way of going about it?\n\n11:14 - What do you think of lit-html?\n\n15:25 - I\'m relatively new to React, and primarily learning the create-react-app way. When do you go for the create-react-app approach when building an application, and when do you customize the config? I\'m uncertain when it\'s time to escape the \'create-react-app\' approach. Also, when escaping it, which main configurations are you grabbing?\n\n18:19 - Is there a reason hasty treat intros are 2.5x the length of normal episodes? Now that Overcast has intro skipping it’d be nice if the intros were uniform in length.\n\n21:23 - I see Kyle Matthews coming out with a lot of input on how Gatsby can be used for web applications as well. After listening to several of your podcasts, where you talk about Gatsby, it doesn\'t seem like you agree, and would go for Next.js instead. In your opinion is the development at Gatsby really heading in the direction of SSG and web application?\n\n27:17 - I\'ve hopped on the Vue train from jQuery land, and am loving both Nuxt and Gridsome. However, I keep hearing all these good things about Gatsby. Would you guys say that it is worth it to learn Gatsby (and the whole react ecosystem for that matter) over Gridsome? This is mostly for small-medium-ish side-project web sites that connect to a headless CMS.\n\n30:04 - What are your thoughts on CSS pre-processors nowadays? With all the advance and new features from CSS, do you guys really think that it is still worthy to use it those?\n\n32:11 - Scott, can you talk a bit about why you decided to switch back to Meteor after putting in all the effort to convert LUT to Next.js? I am about to start a new fullstack project and was considering Next until I heard you switched back. Maybe I should consider Meteor instead?\n\n40:21 - I’ve recently started an internship at one of my favorite tech companies where I’m using EmberJS and Ruby on Rails. I love the team I’m on (the people are so nice) but I’m not super passionate about the tech stack. I’d much rather be using something like React and NodeJS/Express in my day-to-day coding. Do you think it’s worth staying in a position (if I were to try and get a full-time gig in this role) if you don’t like the tech stack, but really like the people?\n\n40:51 - I\'m thinking of doing a bootcamp that teaches Ruby on Rails for backend. I hear a lot that Ruby is a dying language, but at the same time, I know it\'s used for a lot of big-timers, such as Airbnb and Shopify. Could you please explain the relevance that Ruby/Ruby on Rails will have in 2020 forward, as well as if it\'s worth learning for newer web developers at this point?\n\n45:15 - What is the deal with CMSs/headless CMSs? I hear you guys talk about them all the time (Sanity, Keystone, Prisma?) but I\'m not sure what they are good for. To me, they just seem like a UI to my database, but isn\'t that what my application is? It just seems like it would be easier to have my frontend talk to my backend talk to my database instead of learning how each CMS wants things to be done and programming for that? Am I missing the point?\n\n48:11 - What does Svelte needs for each of you to use it instead of React in personal and future developments?\n\n50:38 - I freelance on the side as well as have a 9-5. The other dev I work with mentioned he\'d help if I ever needed/wanted help on a client project. What are your thoughts on doing freelance work with someone who you also work with at your job?\n\n52:01 - My team is currently in the design phase for a rewrite of our biggest product. We are switching from perl backend (y i k e s) to node (yay) but for some reason, our tech lead decided on hapi for the node framework. I have spent a little time with hapi and it seems cool but I am not sure about its longevity when compared to more established frameworks like express. How do you feel about hapi and should I push for a different framework?\n\n54:29 - I\'m a lead dev that recently joined an agency for the first time. What 🔥tips do you have for livin\' and devin\' in that agency life? Especially around time management, time estimation and dealing with clients.\n\n## Links\n* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)\n* [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/)\n* [Recurly](https://recurly.com/)\n* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)\n* [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/)\n* [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)\n* [@kylemathews](https://twitter.com/kylemathews)\n* [Gatsby Build](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/)\n* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)\n* [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)\n* [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)\n* [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/)\n* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)\n* [Ember](https://emberjs.com/)\n* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)\n* [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/)\n* [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/)\n* [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)\n* [Missive](https://missiveapp.com/)\n* [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/syntax)\n* [Keystone](https://www.keystonejs.com/)\n* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)\n* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\n* [hapi](https://hapi.dev/)\n* [koa](https://koajs.com/)\n* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)\n* [Matt Stauffer\'s Blog](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Caffeine by Michael Pollan](https://www.audible.com/pd/Caffeine-Audiobook/B083MVZ91Y)\n* Wes: [Matt Stauffer - Setting Up Your Webcam, Lights, and Audio for Remote Work, Podcasting, Videos, and Streaming](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/setting-up-your-webcam-lights-and-audio-for-remote-work-podcasting-videos-and-streaming/) \n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [New course on Framer Motion](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', 'feb69898abed44b08d9119d1e741ab76104417f6342c84d08ade812330286d04', 'potluck-next-vs-gatsby-headless-cms-vue-js-is-ruby-on-rails-still-good-more', '/shows/226 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:02.664', '2023-10-27 15:57:52.197', 'TASTY'),

Not sure if it\'s an episode idea or not, but if you wanna do a bit of a dive on Cloudflare\'s service workers, I\'m currently leading an \"invisible infrastructure migration\" right now from a legacy WordPress setup to a new Storyblok/Netlify setup. We\'re using Cloudflare\'s service workers to basically \"stitch\" the headers/menus/footers from the old WordPress site into our new Netlify pages, but serving the page back as if it was part of the normal domain. This means we can migrate from the old to the new slowly without massively disrupting SEO, doing a lengthy/costly rebuild, etc.\n\n* A word on Digital Ocean\n* Kubernetes + FAAS allows you to scale up/down\n\n13:54 - Secret management\n\n* Some have a great UI\n* Some have a CLI\n* Some only have production\n* Some have dev/staging/prod\n\n16:24 - Vendor lock-in\n\n* Two kinds of vendor lock-in\n  * Lock into a low-level provider (like AWS, or MongoDB)\n  * Lock into a framework\n* Questions to ask:\n  * Can I go, take my app as-is, and host it on another provider?\n  * Can I refactor the config and run my code as-is?\n  * Do I need to refactor my code for it to run on other platforms?\n* Next.js will only run on Now\n* There is a community package\n* Begin all runs on Arc.codes\n* Firebase is locked in?\n\n25:12 - Sharing dependencies\n\n* Each function will have its own package.json, which can be a pain\n* Publish utils a private module\n* AWS Layers\n* Import/export\n* Bundle and tree shake\n\n30:26 - Local development\n\n* Now dev\n* NPX sandbox\n* Wrangler for Cloudflare workers\n\n36:40 - Existing applications\n\n* Difficult to move with many routes, but easy to move a Graphql API that has one single route\n* Maybe do piece by piece instead of all at once\n* Begin has http express method\n\n45:21 - Data\n\n* Any DB you want\n* Dynamo DB integrated into many\n* Firebase\n* KV Storage for Cloudflare workers\n* [Fauna](https://fauna.com/)\n\n48:14 - File storage\n\n* Generally files go in the associated file place like Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Cloudinary\n* Many also have this integrated as well\n\n52:18 - Auth\n\n* Serverless is ephemeral and stateless\n* JWT likely as sessions will work, but doesn\'t really make sense\n\n## Links\n* [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)\n* [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/)\n* [MongoDB Stitch](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch)\n* [Hitler uses Kubernetes](http://youtube.com/watch?v=9wvEwPLcLcA)\n* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)\n* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)\n* [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)\n* [Architect](https://arc.codes/)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n* [Now.sh](https://zeit.co/home)\n* [Begin](https://begin.com/)\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n* [Now](https://github.com/zeit/now)\n* [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler)\n* [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/)\n* [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)\n* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)\n* [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)\n* [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)\n* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\n* [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html)\n* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)\n* [Fauna](https://fauna.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [The Power of Bad by John Tierney](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Bad-Negativity-Effect-Rules-ebook/dp/B07Q3NHPGZ)\n* Wes: [Socket Organizer](https://amzn.to/2VhBbUt)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Animating React with Framer Motion](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '4baae8bef40418a9ac3a16b594919dc1a2f20362275092119941c2cd7fab303d', 'more-on-severless-databases-files-secrets-auth-more', '/shows/228 - serverless.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:02.757', '2023-10-27 15:57:52.301', 'TASTY'),

Scott, you talk a lot about your workflow with Figma. As a designer going to programming it sounds like the workflow was natural to you. As a programmer trying to move into design, I have no idea how to get started. Could you explain your workflow on starting a new project in Figma through starting to implement in VSCode?\n\n5:36 - The dreaded monitor question, flat or curved?\n\n8:34 - I am relatively new to web development and have learned HTML, CSS, Node and Mongo. I planned on taking your GatsbyJS e-commerce course, however, I have no experience in React whatsoever. Should I learn React first?\n\n12:35 - What is AMP and should I be using it?\n\n16:07 - What are the advantages and disadvantages of building a web app using a framework such as Blitz.js?\n\n21:46 - Would you ever consider moving from Mongo / Mongoose?\n\n24:47 - I am very new to the dev world. Went to college 15 years ago for Comp Sci, but dropped out halfway through to become an electrician. (Wasn\'t sure if I could sit in an office all day.) Long story, but I\'m wanting to change my career path and I\'m very interested in software development. I\'ve heard about Modern Labor\'s bootcamp and I\'m intrigued. I\'d like to know what your take is on their program.\n\n33:15 - Loved your recent episode(s) on serverless functions. I\'ve implemented a few myself, but I always come back to the same question: how exactly do I secure these endpoints? Because you are charged for compute time, and those endpoints are publicly available, couldn\'t anyone just send requests to them and run up your bill?\n\n36:53 - I\'ve decided to make a career out of coding and programming and I\'m an absolute beginner starting out in HTML and CSS. It might be a weird question but how many/what percentage elements and declaratives do I need to memorize? It\'s not that the info is necessarily difficult to parse, it\'s the amount of tags that I\'m bombarding my brain with is muddying my progress. I\'m more of a theory-driven learner so it\'s not the biggest obstacle in the world but I\'m starting to see the breadth of this endeavor and I\'m not sure how to focus my mental acuity.\n\n40:39 - Do you have a standard folder structure that you follow for placing \"utility\" function JS files? Is there an \"industry standard\"? I\'ve just been using `utils` or `utilities` inside `src`, but curious if there is a more common way.\n\n44:12 - Is figuring out new techs/modules/plugins/whatever really as easy as reading the docs for most people? A common response to \"what\'s a good way to learn x\" seems to be \"the docs are good\". I then open the docs and am absolutely clueless. Are these people just giving bad advice, or do the docs actually give most people enough to go on? For example, I tried to implement username login with Passport using their docs, and a lot seemed to be left out, implying you\'re supposed to just already know all this other stuff. It\'s a bit demoralizing to feel like I can\'t figure out much of anything on my own, and I\'ve been doing web dev for a few years now, albeit not professionally, but I have done some big projects that are used regularly. So anyway, just wondering what your take on this common advice is, your experience with being able to figure out things on your own without needing an hour-long tutorial, and so on. I know you\'re both tutorial makers, but I don\'t get the impression that you two have to take a course to understand something new.\n\n48:19 - Do you have any tips for getting over \"code shyness\" or \"imposter syndrome\"? I find myself struggling with this issue from time to time and was curious to know your suggestions for dealing with it.\n\n53:36 - If I rename my GitHub repo, will all the links that are in the wild still work. For instance will github.com/webruin map to github.com/newname?	\n\n## Links\n* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)\n* [AMP](https://amp.dev/)\n* [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/)\n* [Brandon Blitz](https://twitter.com/flybayer)\n* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)\n* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)\n* [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)\n* [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)\n* [Course Report - Modern Labor](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/modern-labor)\n* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)\n* [Syntax 058: Advice For Beginners - Tech Skills, Applying for Jobs, Focus, Imposter Syndrome + More](https://syntax.fm/show/058/advice-for-beginners-tech-skills-applying-for-jobs-focus-imposter-syndrome-more)\n* [Syntax 015: Advice for New Developers, Imposter Syndrome and Interviewing at Google](https://syntax.fm/show/015/advice-for-new-developers-imposter-syndrome-and-interviewing-at-google)\n* [Syntax 075: Hasty Treat - Feedback and Criticism](https://syntax.fm/show/075/hasty-treat-feedback-and-criticism)\n* [Brendan Eich](https://twitter.com/BrendanEich)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Stronger by Science Podcast](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/podcast/)\n* Wes: [iStat Menus](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/istat-menus/id1319778037)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Animating React with Framer Motion](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'fc513c8ba17830e25a5bca7fa36c6368673edd048ac6082016d2668fd870b6b2', 'potluck-bootcamps-career-change-figma-gatsby-amp-mongoose-more', '/shows/234 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:03.107', '2023-10-27 15:57:52.594', 'TASTY'),

Do you throw the desktop styles or the mobile styles in media queries? Any opinions about that? I\'m switching a lot between projects that do it differently, and it really makes my head melt.\n\n08:24 - Q: What is the difference between the ES6 arrow functions and a normal function? When would you use a normal function instead of an arrow function or the other way around?\n\n13:54 - Q: What are your opinions or experiences on developing 360/VR experiences on the web? There are a few frameworks out there for building such experiences, like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/).

I feel like most, if not all, clients want to take administrative control at the end of the project to be able to handle things themselves. Does this mean the only option for client projects is WordPress? I got really excited about making a client\'s site in Gatsby, but they would need to be a coder to be able to edit the content of the site or maintain it.

Right now every time I visit a project so much of the code is not spaced out that it makes it hard to read quickly for me, lots of the React code is bunched up with no spacing - it\'s a mess to read for me especially because I am very organized. If this was your situation where you know a new tool/standard is something that can help a lot but it\'s shot down, do you just give up? I don\'t know how to respond to this because I am the only dev who has ever proposed this at my company and I just started here.\n\n05:03 - Lots to unpack here\n\n1. Some senior devs don\'t like getting suggestions from other devs. There is a sense that these things change quickly and I bet there is some anxiety over that at play here.\n2. Senior devs know better than to slap new tools into the codebase because they have probably done it and regretted it. What if it broke your code.\n\n08:20 - So what can you do?\n\n1. Ask for their thoughts on a tool instead of suggesting it - it seems you have done this already\n2. Show the dev that even though it looks weird, it\'s better for readability. \n3. Look at existing guidelines and try to match the settings as close as possible (not always an option with prettier).\n4. Put together a solid argument for it, written down.\n5. Use it in a smaller project. Everyone is against prettier at first, but once they use it, they realize how amazing it is.\n6. Can you just Prettier the code yourself and then format it otherwise before you check it in? This depends on if you have existing formats.\n\n## Links\n* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)\n* [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '8cc4be1033e4b7795fce1d7e97b351a5505a4dfd9d2304e0f02fdcc7331eb0cf', 'hasty-treat-getting-buy-in-for-a-tool-like-prettier-from-your-team', '/shows/243 - prettier.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:03.798', '2023-10-27 15:57:53.187', 'HASTY'),

I have a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site with a lot of images and want to use something like Cloudinary to help with optimization, but the docs aren\'t completely clear to me how to get the most out of their service.\n\n10:58 - Q: What kind of CSS pre/post-processor you usually use? What are the pros and cons of pre-processor (SASS, SCSS, LESS) and post-processor (PostCSS)?\n\n16:22 - Q: What is the most effective way to share a project with the internet and get feedback? I\'m in a phase right now where I\'m building loads of new web things with React and JavaScript, but the only place I can think to share them is my Twitter, where only like 3 people will see them.\n\n18:35 - Q: What are your thoughts on classes in JavaScript? Do we still need them in 2020, or has the functional programming paradigm made them largely unnecessary? Does the answer change based on the size of the project and/or team?\n\n23:56 - Q: Does ES2020 have `var`? Also, is ES2020 a real spec or just a term people are using?\n\n27:37 - Q: Have you tried [gqless](https://gqless.dev/), a graphql client alternative to something like Apollo client? Very interesting idea for clean and maintainable code.\n\n29:15 - Q: What are the main differences in working for a software agency and a software product company? Pros and cons of each?\n\n33:53 - Q: Advice for having static blog with minimal moving parts? I used to have a static blog but I eventually got sick of touching it because instead of writing content I often got stuck keeping up with all the dependencies involved.\n\n38:18 - Q: Micro Frontends—is it the solution to rewriting legacy components?\n\n42:16 - Q: I am relatively new to web development and I feel like it is very difficult to \"catch up\" with JavaScript. It seems like whenever I try to contribute an open source, I can\'t figure out the code because they\'re using newer (and presumably better) ways of doing things. How can I get up to date with everything that\'s going on in the JavaScript world? Also, at what point should I start learning a front-end framework?\n\n46:56 - Q: My team and I are starting to write pretty complicated custom hooks gathering data from a number of different endpoints and/or polling certain endpoints on a continuous interval timer before returning it to the component that needs the data. Since this is the case some hooks have gotten fairly large with multiple functions inside of them getting called to get/manipulate all the data, or multiple hooks using those same functions to get slightly different data. Is it a best practice to keep all those hooks together in one file if they support all the hooks? Or should we break the hooks into separate files and move the helper functions into another file and just have one hook per file?\n\n51:10 - Q: Any tips for navigating projects with bad project managers? Working with non-technical agency project managers makes it pretty difficult to effectively plan and allocate time to ensure that all of the projects are done on time, on budget, and done well. It\'s important to me to maintain an optimistic attitude in the organization, but sometimes I\'d love to just hit \'em with the \'ol \"Peace out\" and go smoke some pork butt. Wondering if you guys have any good experience managing these types of projects?\n\n55:45 - Q: I\'m committing often and early, but this means that I end up writing the same vague git commit message over and over again. I know the solution to the problem is to just be more verbose, but it\'s a difficult habit to break. Any advice?\n\n## Links\n* [imgIX](https://www.imgix.com/)\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)\n* [Less](http://lesscss.org/)\n* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n* [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)\n* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)\n* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)\n* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)\n* [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/)\n* [Gridsom](https://gridsome.org/)\n* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)\n* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)\n* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Jelle\'s Marble Runs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJdpnjuSWVOLgGT9fIzL0g)\n* Wes: [Hyundai HHC2GNK Vertical Style Electric Air Compressor](https://www.amazon.ca/Hyundai-HHC2GNK-Vertical-Electric-Compressor/dp/B00ISLYLKI/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=nail%2Bgun%2Bcompressor&qid=1586882118&sr=8-4&th=1)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Level Up Tutorials Pro](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '3ff58766d2c384d84c7696ebc03b95033a98862921ed8906e32d12e57ffb026d', 'potluck-part-2-magic-gqless-are-classes-dead-custom-hooks-staying-up-to-date-css-more', '/shows/244 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:03.835', '2023-10-27 15:57:53.243', 'TASTY'),

What are good ways to do that? Should you embed something like a GitHub Gist, or setup something specific for your blog?\n\n11:13 - Q: Do my students NEED to understand recursion to be effective JS devs?\n\n15:41 - Q: What do you think about developing using just an iPad + keyboard + external monitor? To try this, I just moved all my environment to a VM on the cloud and configured code-server (a VSCode accessed by the web https://github.com/cdr/code-server). Works pretty well! The only problem now is that the iPad has a bad resolution on the external monitor when I\'m using the browser.\n\n22:43 - Q: I often find myself refactoring sub-components out of a component once it gets too big. This however is very tedious, especially if the sub-component is tightly coupled with the component and thus needs to take a lot of props. Do you have any suggestions? Do you just let the component grow bigger in a case like that?\n\n26:15 - Q: [Insert Hoser related greeting here], during quarantine I\'ve tried to come up with an outline for creating a goofy Pokémon app with my boys (age 8 and 5). They\'re obsessed with Pokémon right now and I figure this could be a fun little group activity. I see how much they struggle focusing on some of the online instruction they have through school, and they\'re a bit fatigued with \"learning\" right now. We tried doing a bit of scratch/scratch jr. I figured a fun-themed project could help them stay engaged with learning, but I\'m struggling with where to start. How would you go about creating a course/activities (like Wes\' Javascript 30 course) specifically designed for primary/elementary aged kids?\n\n30:52 - Q: How much should someone who wants to work as a web developer (starting in a junior position) know about data structures and algorithms? Should I practice algorithms and do questions before applying for jobs?\n\n33:53 - Q: I\'m working with a friend to start up a website for our YouTube channel, and we\'re getting into podcasts too (not tech-related so no competition, no worries). I\'m thinking about trying to host my own RSS feed for podcasts to save some bucks. Am I crazy?\n\n36:27 - Q: Do you guys name your colors in terms of the color or the use of the color. For example, say you styled all your links to be purple. Would you name that color \"purple\" or \"link\"?\n\n41:00 - Q: I\'ve been listening to you for about a month and really dig it. I\'m working on an app that will require a couple of different databases. I\'ll need a database for user information, and a larger database for application data. The app does some analytics stuff, so data is critical. I\'m getting lost in the world of hosted database options (mLab, Digital Ocean, etc.) and big cloud providers (AWS, Google, etc.). Could you guys talk a little bit about how you choose database hosting? Bonus question - have you ever used Auth0 or Okta for user authentication?\n\n45:09 - Q: I\'m a bit confused about using GitHub. What happens to the files that are ignored, but required for development? What\'s the best practice for backing up both? I have used .env files, but not too sure how it works if it\'s in the gitignore and the site is deployed via GitHub (like with Netlify). Right now I have a backup folder on my hard drive and I back up both the dev and the live versions with a timestamp, whenever I do a new \'release\'. Also, you spoke about Jetpack, and I\'d be curious what\'s the best way to do this with a cronjob for example.\n\n48:50 - Q: I was laid off in early April because of COVID-19. I\'ve been trying to file unemployment since then. The state unemployment office said they were launching an updated website for filing claims on Friday, April 24th. At 9:00am that day, they ran a banner saying demand has been so high that it\'s affecting the process \'despite rigorous testing.\' Why is this so hard to scale?\n\n55:57 - Q: What is your take on all of these rails-like server side rendered React and GraphQL frameworks? Here is another one built by Michael Jackson, Ryan Florence and some others: https://twitter.com/remix_run.

Would love to hear your opinion on the tech, view on the approach and why we could need another browser in 2020. Peace!\n\n09:34 - Q: Who would win in a thumb war, Wes or Scott?\n\n10:56 - Q: What are your thoughts on XState and state machines for managing state in apps? I\'ve been super interested in trying to use it, eager to hear what you both think. Also, wondering if you\'d have any recommendations on how to use it with Apollo, whether to use XState\'s internal context to store app state, or use the Apollo cache.\n\n14:53 - Q: Should I start a new project with jQuery or React?\n\n17:21 - Q: I\'m a young teen (<16) with a passion for all things web dev. However, without being able to legally have a job, I\'m unable to make any money and am therefore running on a $50 Raspberry Pi and a 10+ year old monitor. As much as I love my Pi, just running `npm install` can be agonizing sometimes, not to mention the amount of space node_modules take up on a device with 16GB of storage! So basically, any pointers on getting income (and practice!) in the web development field when your under 16? And just in general, what advice do you have to young teen learning to code? Thanks in advance! P.S. You know you\'ve got something going when a teenaged boy would rather listen to your podcast than watch Star Wars or Marvel with his friends! ;) So keep up the amazing work.\n\n22:12 - Q: Is it worth my time to learn design patterns in JavaScript?\n\n24:28 - Q: I have a question regarding Figma design to HTML/CSS conversion. When translating the design into code, do you keep the font-size, padding, height of images the same as defined in design or do you take something different? Let\'s suppose top nav bar is 115px, then do you make it the same as well, or something else?\n\n29:03 - Q: You both are great at technical communication — how do you get better at technical communication when self-learning?\n\n33:06 - Q: What tools (or other methods) do y\'all use to manage spinning up new projects with all the assorted directory structures, tools, and configs, you prefer? For example, when I start a new project, these days I like TS, Prettier, ESLint, and want those to play nicely together. I find I\'m constantly copying files from one project to the other but haven\'t found a good abstraction that allows me to setup a new project with the assorted files. Bonus points for a solution that can keep shared configs and deps up to date.\n\n36:10 - Q: I am 26 years old and working a full-time job. I am currently looking at the possibility between work and spending time with my partner. I get maybe an hour a week (maybe two) to focus on learning Javascript. I feel like it is taking me literally forever to get anywhere, and when I do learn something, there is always a better way of doing it! And then when I do sit down and get the time I just feel like I have no direction. Your podcast has been giving me small boosts of motivation, so thanks for that. But is 26 too old to make a move into development?\n\n39:39 - Q: How do you step up a web development project to an enterprise-level? There are so many simple tutorials and quick wins all over the internet, but how do you get more knowledge about bigger enterprise-ready technical stuff. E.g. How to organize a Vue app with >60 different pages? How do you organize the REST-ful API? How do you resolve dependencies between API endpoint 1 and API endpoint 2? How do you share information between multiple components in VUE-State-Management?\n\n42:44 - Q: I\'ve done Wes\' NextJS course and he uses Styled Components instead of Next\'s own styled-jsx. What are your opinions on styled-jsx, and why you do (or do not) use it?\n\n## Links\n* [React](https://reactjs.org/)\n* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)\n* [Brave](https://brave.com/)\n* [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)\n* [VS Code in the browser](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)\n* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)\n* [Source Making Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns)\n* [Figma Auto Layout](https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott:\n  * 1: [Myths and Legends Podcast](https://www.mythpodcast.com/)\n  * 2: [Fictional Podcast](https://www.fictional.fm/)\n* Wes: [Parchment Paper Baking Sheets](https://amzn.to/2A9c5P0)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Sapper For Beginners](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner JavaScript Course](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '28996e5b3e9f3137edf794e4eaf6d2a227505eca3474c95baf9c1a90b8303f85', 'potluck-libraries-vs-frameworks-firefox-career-advice-for-teenagers-who-would-win-a-thumb-war-more', '/shows/260 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:04.507', '2023-10-27 15:57:54.187', 'TASTY'),

I have been primarily on the frontend using Angular and templating with Handlebars and other HTML and CSS. I have been asked if I would be interested in moving more into backend, with a focus on Node.js. Outside of creating APIs, what else should I do to learn \"backend\"?\n\n06:08 - I work as a web master and would like to be a frontend developer someday. Currently I am working on a MERN stack app on my own to enhance my skills, but have problems focusing and tend to procrastinate a lot. How do you tackle distractions and get things done? I would appreciate some tips.	\n\n11:00 - Rollup or Webpack? Webpack 5 still doesn\'t seem to support ES6 module output, [as described by Philip Walton](https://philipwalton.com/articles/using-native-javascript-modules-in-production-today/), so instead of upgrading to Webpack 5, this might be a good time to think about switching to Rollup (or Parcel).\n\n13:46 - I have been learning web development (HTML, CSS and JS) and am at a place where I can build simple websites for small businesses, but I feel like a beginner and am wondering if you have any recommendations on courses to get to a more intermediate/advanced level?\n\n18:01 - Why should you choose Styled Components over other ways of writing CSS?\n\n22:56 - What are your thoughts on companies that make senior developer roles require leadership responsibilities? A great technical person does not always make a great leader or visa versa.\n\n26:36 - I am often not good at planning out code from the start. I find that it\'s easier to start coding, write a few lines, run it to see where I\'m at, and carry on. This technique doesn\'t work when I need to wait for a deploy to finish before I can view the result, as it greatly increases dev time. Do you have any advice for what I can do better?\n\n31:43 - I have a very random question. for context I\'m a Mac and Linux user myself. However, recently while building our company application I\'ve noticed that Windows does extremely weird things with font sizes. Since we have a pretty decent Windows user base, obviously this is something my partner and I want to solve. However I\'m very unsure of the best way to handle it. It seems entirely different from user to user. How in the world do we as developers account for these inconsistencies? We have tried vertical media queries that more or less kick them to tablet mode. Obviously this is less than optimal.\n\n37:50 - Are side projects common among developers? I recently mentioned to my boss that I have a few side projects - nothing serious, just for learning mostly - and he said he would rather I didn\'t, and instead focus on my work. He said he hadn\'t really heard of developers doing side projects, and that if I want to work on things that aren\'t our work he has other things I can do.\n\n## Links\n* [inputmag.com](https://inputmag.com)\n* [Focus app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-time-management/id777233759?mt=12)\n* [TSdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsdx?activeTab=readme)\n* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)\n* [Webapck](https://webpack.js.org/)\n* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)\n* [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/)\n* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n* [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Malicious Life Podcast](https://malicious.life/)\n* Wes: [LaCie Rugged USB-C External HDD](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=LaCie+Rugged+USB-C&ref=nb_sb_noss)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Modern CSS Design Systems](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'fb40d9169da3b8c8ade733398d0d71ed6e7e5f12e0ce511bdc18ba992fd1e57d', 'potluck-beating-procrastination-rollup-vs-webpack-leadership-code-planning-styled-components-more', '/shows/268 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:04.948', '2023-10-27 15:57:54.582', 'TASTY'),

That\'s why\nStackbit is the best way to Jamstack. [stackbit.com](https://www.stackbit.com/).\n\n## Show Notes\n\n02:11 - What are \"subscriptions\" in React, or in programming in general? The React docs mention that setting up a subscription is an example of a side effect, but what exactly is a subscription, and how do you set one up?	\n\n05:43 - Using the latest node esm imports, is it possible to use aliases? Using the old require() syntax I used the npm package module-alias (https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias), but I cannot seem to find a solution for node v14 imports. In a deeply nested file, I find the import \'../../../some/folder\' syntax to be awful compared to require(\'@/some/folder\').\n\n09:20 - I\'ve been a full-time developer for over 10 years and my company has a fairly flat hierarchy. I want to take on more responsibility (and salary) but my company doesn\'t have anything like a \"lead developer\" position. Any ideas for how to move up without switching companies? I know my boss would be receptive if I came to him with a pitch, but we work full stack so it feels like I\'m already doing it all.\n\n12:59 - In Wes’ website episode, he mentioned using Gatsby Parallels for images. Why not git LFS?	\n\n17:25 - For Wes: Any Big Green Egg tips for beginners? I just ordered a kamado style grill and I\'d appreciate any tasty tips you\'ve got.	\n\n22:45 - Inline code is considered harmful because of potential XSS attacks. Lighthouse recommends inlining critical CSS to improve page speed. What do you think about this tradeoff?\n\n26:30 - What advice would both of you have for being a first-time father, and how can I best prepare? My wife is pregnant, and we are both very excited! I want to do the best I can at being a good father. Our baby is due in January. As both of you are fathers (multiple times), I would love to hear your thoughts.\n\n32:58 - Are present web developers merely crud bastards for corporate culture? If not, What entrepreneurial opportunities are open with Javascript and hooking up React with backend Node/Laravel and reading the Google Map docs? Of course the list isn\'t exhaustive but you get my point right? Note: I\'m not interested in selling courses and creating frameworks.\n\n37:08 - Do you have any use for ES6 Generators and `yield`? It seems that they are a mechanism for async-await \"under the hood,\" so using \'async-await\' is probably sufficient.	\n\n39:10 - With a legacy project that has old build dependencies how do you decide when to retool and fix all the npm audit issues?\n\n46:10 - In what instances do you prefer to use rem vs em vs pixels for font size? I usually think about it like so: if I\'m okay with an element\'s font size being sized based on the parent, then I\'ll use em. If not, then I\'ll use rem. I almost never use pixels anymore except sometimes on the html element. But even then, I usually use a percentage. In practice, I\'ve found it a bit hard to gauge what to expect with ems because of nesting issues. So, I\'ve mostly been leaning towards rem. Though I also understand that using rems can be less modular. How do you guys make the decision?\n\n52:49 - Hello chaps. Thank you so much for the show, I\'ve learned an awful lot through listening. I\'ve been dabbling in development for some time now and have taken on a project for an Express site which aside from a few static pages will include a shop with a small number of items (<5), customer dashboard (order tracking and submitting supplementary order info), and an image centric journal/blog section. I\'ve listened and re-listened to your CMS roundup which is great, but having worked through Wes\' Node course I\'m kinda thinking why would I spend the time integrating a CMS when I can just build an \'Add Post\' page for admin users, save the posts in Mongo, upload images to my server, and use Cloudflare\'s free tier CDN. Please explain why this is (or isn\'t🤷‍♂️) a bad idea, and more generally share your wisdom on when a CMS is or isn\'t actually necessary.

I\'d love to learn more about pros and cons, if you guys had a chance to use it.	\n\n08:49 - Where would you put business logic in Vue.js middle- or large-scale applications? I try to put business logic in store but it makes hard to maintain such store, even with splitting to actions/getters/mutations files. I ended up using vanilla JavaScript files, where each file is a class singleton. I was wondering: is it a good solution or do you have better alternatives in mind?\n\n12:07 - I commonly find myself engineering complex programs and left flabbergasted on how to express these ideas to other people when the need arises that I need to explain them and remember why I did them a certain way. How can I get better at conceptualizing intricate design patterns or functions as well as have better memory recall for these abstractions?\n\n18:02 - Can I get recommendations for a junior dev portfolio? What five projects you would recommend to build that will significantly help in getting a job as a front-end web dev and why?\n\n21:13 - I am now working on building a minesweeper game with React. You know how on a computer you right click to flag and disable a cell? I am thinking of doing a press and hold on a mobile device instead. I am not sure how to do either (the right click logic or the press and hold). How can you listen for these events in React? Can you help with some guidance or resources? :)	\n\n30:00 - What are your thoughts on [SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com/) as a Rails-equivalent framework in Javascript? They recently released version 1.0 and I\'m wondering if I should start using it in projects or if I should wait to see if it pans out.\n\n34:35 - How do you go about creating reusable React components (reusable from project to project)? Do you create packages and publish them to NPM? Or do you have another method for storing code for components that you will likely need to use again?	\n\n38:33 - Thoughts on shadow dom / custom elements? Would you use them in your own projects?\n\n40:49 - How do you organize CSS properties within a rule and why? Random, alphabetical, logical groupings, etc.	\n\n46:04 - Have u ever used the 2nd parameter of JSON.stringify for anything useful?	\n\n48:00 - Getting my first dev job at an actual software company a year ago opened my eyes to the vast difference between educational repos and the absolute jungle that can be enterprise code bases. I\'ve also learned the importance of writing code that will be readable later - ensuring any hacky workaround is replaced with a pattern seen elsewhere in the code base, etc. My question is - are there resources on these sorts of topics for folks trying to break into the industry? A lot of tech topics revolve around how to get your code to run, which feels to me like only half the battle. Where can juniors find resources on robustness?\n\n## Links\n* [https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck)\n* [https://mdsvex.com/](https://mdsvex.com/)\n* [Spectacle](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/)\n* [MDsveX](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX)\n* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)\n* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)\n* [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)\n* [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)\n* [Kap](https://getkap.co/)\n* [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com/)\n* [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/)\n* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)\n* [https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Easy Snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inu1255.easy-snippet)\n* Wes: [WOW Pool Noodles](https://www.amazon.com/17-2062LG-Foam-Pool-Noodle-Green/dp/B01N5USCX3/)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [All Courses](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '96d485d093e364970e2c489d787a37786bbe06f2a9ff1c77ff2fef5f1ffc9d4f', 'potluck-mdx-portfolio-projects-code-commenting-css-properties-reusable-components-more', '/shows/278 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:05.418', '2023-10-27 15:57:55.152', 'TASTY'),

I am married with 2 kids (3 and 1) so finding time to code is difficult. My current situation includes waking up at 4:30 am everyday just to get in some time before the kids wake up. Do either of you have any tips about finding a balance between raising kids, getting stuff done around the house, having a full time job and trying to teach yourself web development to transition into a different career?\n\n13:23 - If you had to use a drag-n-drop framework using React, which one would you choose?\n\n15:49 - E2E vs Visual Regression Testing? At which web-app development cycle to implement each? Best tools open source vs purchase?\n\n20:36 - I teach a Highschool course in web development. For a group of students who have a solid knowledge of HTML/CSS and a decent understanding of JavaScript, would Svelte be a good framework for entering into component-based development for the first time?\n\n22:33 - What\'s a good Google Analytics alternative in 2020? I have a site on Netlify that the $9/mo seems a bit steep for, for what the site is, and flipping the domain through Cloudflare just for the analytics seems crazy; but is it worth it? Alternatives would be awesome, as I\'d love to get off the Google overlords.\n\n29:22 - I have noticed about a dozen to 100 unique clones of my git repos after each push. It doesn’t matter if the repo is initialized, picture added or the readme updated. The repos are still cloned. The traffic section shows the views to my repo at 1 sometimes 2. Is this normal? Is this how interested employers keep tabs on you? Are there a lot of malicious git users? What is happening?\n\n32:30 - With Apple switching to their own processors is it silly for anyone to buy a Mac for development before that releases? Do you guys have experience with Windows, and which would you still prefer today if you needed to buy?\n\n40:28 - Have you ever been approached by or heard of GitAds.io? They\'re trying to pay developers to put ads onto popular open source libraries on Github, and they approached me recently, and I wasn\'t sure what to think about them. What do you think?\n\n45:16 - I just listened to your TLD game. It made me wonder your opinions on personal site domain names? Should it always try to be yourname.dev? What about .me or other domains?\n\n47:53 - What\'s the best way to introduce new technology or processes to a team?\n\n## Links\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\n* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)\n* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)\n* [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons)\n* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)\n* [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)\n* [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)\n* [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)\n* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)\n* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)\n* [Percy.io](https://percy.io/)\n* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\n* [Heap](https://heap.io/)\n* [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/2XTH1G)\n* [GitAds.io](https://www.gitads.io/)\n* [.TECH](https://get.tech/)\n* [Syntax 179: Hasty Treat - The TLD Game](https://syntax.fm/show/179/hasty-treat-the-tld-game)\n* [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/)\n* [Syntax 206: Hasty Treat - The New MacBook Pro for Web Development](https://syntax.fm/show/205/hasty-treat-the-new-macbook-pro-for-web-development)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Turbo Boost Switcher for Mac OS X](http://tbswitcher.rugarciap.com/)\n* Wes: [Roller Blade Wheels for your chair](https://amzn.to/34sAtIB)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [React 3D](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Master Gatsby](https://mastergatsby.com/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '1acbd83fbbfb242c002b5407f24423a62b446342ec75ad3e1900e5e3b0cd514a', 'potluck-rip-firefox-safari-changing-careers-regression-testing-google-analytics-alternatives-malicious-github-users-mac-vs-windows-more', '/shows/280 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:05.514', '2023-10-27 15:57:55.229', 'TASTY'),

You mentioned how adding `rel=\"noopener\"` and / or `rel=\"noreferrer\"` can secure this functionality, but what\'s to stop a savvy person from going into the dev tools and deleting these attributes before clicking a link? Does this defeat the entire purpose or what? Surely browsers have thought of this and it\'s not so easy to hack?\n\n03:48 - Why did you not mention [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) when talking about web-component in the last Potluck? Can I presume you have not heard of it? It is quite successful and Ionic proves it. We\'ve been using it for two years in production. This is the only library that thought web-components through to the end. If you know it, what do you think about it and would you use it?\n\n* Example of a stencil component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Component, Prop, h } from \'@stencil/core\';\n\n@Component({\n  tag: \'my-first-component\',\n})\nexport class MyComponent {\n\n  // Indicate that name should be a public property on the component\n  @Prop() name: string;\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <p>\n        My name is {this.name}\n      </p>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n06:12 - Is [https://www.syntax.fm](https://www.syntax.fm/) supposed to not work? I get a 404.\n\n07:34 - I’m wondering what advice you’d have for someone self-taught switching from a totally non-tech industry (non profit arts, in my case) where I work in a tech role. I’ve hustled and built a portfolio of projects and learned a ton from both of your courses, but I feel that my experience is seen as less valuable because I don’t work in a traditional software/web development environment. Any tips for getting over the final hurdle of getting a dev job?\n\n11:11 - What makes a software engineer senior?\n\n13:08 - I have a Gatsby / Netlify client project about to launch. What’s the best approach in handing over to the (non technical) client? Do I keep in my Github account and just give the client the Netlify CMS login, or create the a Github account for the client that I can access for any maintenance? What do other devs do?\n\n17:55 - I recently blocked all cookies on my mobile browser (Google Chrome), and I noticed something weird. A couple of sites that I know for a fact to have been built using NextJS weren\'t working as expected (surprise surprise). They would load as usual, and after a second or so, all the content on the page disappeared, with the error message \"sorry: an unexpected error has occurred\". In some cases, the error was printed in the site\'s font, and with the same background color on the body. Why does blocking cookies do this to NextJS sites?\n\n21:21 - How often do you make commits? I always hear, \"commit often\", but I am hesitant because I feel like I may change my code later on before I make a pull request? I really liked your episode on Git Fundamentals, I would love to see a tutorial/deep dive into Git workflows and practices (when to commit / how often) Should I commit even though I know what I\'m working on isn\'t complete or I need to refactor it?? What is code review etiquette?\n\n26:59 - Wes, how do you handle captioning and transcripts on your courses? Do you use some tool or service for that or do you do it by hand?	\n\n31:11 - I am a recent graduate of a code school that focused on React and Rails. The company that I currently work for uses Angular for part of their stack. I eventually would like to move into a dev spot, but I am finding that Angular feels a bit stuffy and I am not as excited about it as React, Svelte, Vue, etc. I am afraid that if I dive into Angular, I will become less relevant down the road. I want to learn everything, but I only have so much time and don\'t want to stunt my growth as a developer. Any thoughts or advice on this would be sick!\n\n36:38 - How do you handle SVGs in React? I know that SVGR exists, but I\'d like to avoid adding another dependency if it\'s something I can roll on my own. In the past, I\'ve created functions that take parameters like fill or stroke to control color, and return a string of SVG code with the arguments interpolated in. Then I place that string into a component using dangerouslySetInnerHTML. I haven\'t seen this method used anywhere else, and is probably not best practice. But also, it works, so maybe it\'s fine?\n\n39:52 - What social media platforms should you use as a Dev? What is cool to have? What are their benefits?\n\n48:14 - Have you tried an ultrawide monitor for coding, such as 34\" or 38\"? I feel the extra width would be great for a single monitor setup, but haven\'t been able to see one live where I live.\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 269: Hasty Treat - Target=_blank security issue?

When they click the link, render a regular <a> instead of a pushstate link.\n* Use a service worker. They will emit an event when a new version is available.

Be clear on what you need, when you need it, and on what terms. This is business.\n    * This is your art, but it\'s also your business\n* Pay quarterly taxes - most likely\n    * Or don\'t and take the small hit — then you can pay once a year\n* Put taxes into another account if you aren\'t good with money\n* Get a billing management system or get an accountant — you need to focus on working on code\n    * Wave Apps, Xero, Freshbooks\n\n42:03 - Marketing\n* Be loud — people need to know what you offer\n* The best marketing is a referral from a previous client\n* If you show up, return emails and do a good job, you\'ll kill it\n* Show people what you are excited about: blog posts, videos, tweets, etc.\n* Go where your clients are:\n    * Do you want to be serving small businesses? Family and friends\n    * Do you want to be a hired gun for a technical team? Conferences/Twitter, blog posts\n\n48:25 - Final thoughts\n* Scott — It\'s ok if freelancing isn\'t for you. Not everyone is great at all of these factors, myself included. However, with practice, you can be your own boss, work on your own terms, and make money. Also, don\'t be afraid to take on longer contracts with established teams and companies.\n* Wes — Freelancing can be a great filler between jobs or career transitions.\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 117: Hasty Treat - How To Email Busy People](https://syntax.fm/show/117/hasty-treat-how-to-email-busy-people)\n* [Freshbooks - Breaking the Time Barrier](https://www.freshbooks.com/fbstaticprod-uploads/public-website-assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf)\n* [Design Is a Job - Mike Monteiro](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job)\n* [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/)\n* [Xero](https://www.xero.com/)\n* [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Displaced Gamers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DisplacedGamers)\n* Wes: [Battery Adapter for DeWALT 20V Max 18v Dock Power Connector](https://www.amazon.com/battery-adapter-DeWALT-connector-robotics/dp/B07HKGM78H) \n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [React For Everyone](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Master Gatsby](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '3714955650b0b40d8a069dfd93fa534cb26bdd8d4b080073f7f6fe869d62252a', 'how-to-make-freelancing-easier', '/shows/292 - freelancing.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:06.162', '2023-10-27 15:57:55.824', 'HASTY'),

It first puts all the items that are explicitly placed onto the grid. Items that you have a set start/stop value for are first put down.\n  2. Then it takes the next item that it to be placed and finds a spot for it. This is different because with CSS Grid you normally have to place the next item on the next row or column.\n  3. `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` can now be marked as masonry and this specifies which axis will be masonry.\n\n09:06 - The implicit grid\n* [https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#%23implicit-grid](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#%23implicit-grid)\n* The implicit grid is formed in the same way as a regular grid container. However, it’s only used in the grid axis.\n* Interesting in a column situation (see images).\n\n13:25 - Thoughts\n* Power tools for layout in CSS — opens up a ton of possibilities and completes the functionality we use to dream of in CSS.\n\n## Links\n* [David DeSandro](https://desandro.com/)\n* [https://metafizzy.co/](https://metafizzy.co/)\n* [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/)\n* [https://caniuse.com/](https://caniuse.com/)\n* [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/)\n* [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '6540accaa3808f185e77291532638460856518cf4fbe103070d1252fff0546bc', 'hasty-treat-css-grid-masonry-grid-level-3', '/shows/301 - css grid.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:06.727', '2023-10-27 15:57:56.284', 'HASTY'),

Check that correct types are coming in. Very easy with Graphql.\n2. Get current stock and price information from unique ids from the database.\n3. Confirm that this information is what the user is expecting — if the UI said the user will be charged $40, don\'t charge them $50 just because of the updated info. In that case, send back to the user.\n\n17:17 - What do you do if you don\'t want people messing with your React state?\n* `@fvilers/disable-react-devtools`\n* `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === \'production\') disableReactDevTools()`\n* We do this on LUT. Why? Because it\'s a deterrent.\n\n## Links\n* [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)\n* [Flipp App](https://flipp.com/home)\n* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'ccc372e20a601c60bcee75a0b9e0f8dd7d007cceebcdf5caea9036737166d6a9', 'hasty-treat-client-vs-server-data-validation', '/shows/303 - validation.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:06.916', '2023-10-27 15:57:56.434', 'HASTY'),

Please tell us more about online streaming, screen sharing, data flow. \n\n03:20 - Which JS library/framework do you think beginners might find the easiest to understand?\n\n05:06 - How do you deal with different case types between different systems in your project? For example, I store records in a Postgres database which typically uses snake_case and then I render them with React, where props are typically camelCase. Is it better to convert the cases back and forth between frontend and backend or just pick one case and use it everywhere?	\n\n09:23 - My question is about the difference between a framework and a library. Should we have two separate words?\n\n12:39 - How can I work on improving both my generic problem-solving skills and my debugging skills? I feel like there have got to be some more proactive things I can do to improve in these areas.\n\n17:22 - I just listened to your podcast on making freelancing easier and enjoyed it. You talk about making your own component library. Do you have tips on how to store and manage a component library?\n\n21:39 - What projects do you use Rust for, and do you have any ideas where Rust might be the thing to do when talking web projects?\n\n29:10 - I\'ve recently joined a great-paying full-time gig at a big enterprise-level company as a Senior Javascript Engineer (React, Node, etc). I\'m humbled to be here - but at times the pace is slow, tickets are scarce, and I feel like I\'m not able to really utilize or hone my skillset. I\'ve been looking at potentially moving into contracting/agency work - the money seems comparable with the added benefit of new and exciting projects and having more control over them. Do you think contract work would be more fulfilling, or is crazy to leave a cushy job solely because I\'m in a sense, bored?\n\n35:26 - I\'m currently working on a Next.js project and trying to decide which CSS system to use. What is your take on CSS modules? I know you like styled components a lot, but since there is built-in support for CSS modules with scoped CSS, I find it hard to motivate bringing in styled components. Am I missing something?\n\n38:15 - Regarding Episode 290, you fielded a question regarding Angular and I appreciated your balanced response since I\'m primarily an Angular developer at my job. If you could, would you please update the link to the Angular website to point to [Angular.io](http://angular.io/) (v10) instead of the AngularJS (v1) website?\n\n40:43 - I really need advice on how to write a good resume, or any tips you may have for getting noticed in the hiring process with only a couple years of experience. I have been applying to many jobs as a front-end developer but I seem to get no response EVER.\n\n45:17 - How do I dynamically assign subdomain/wildcard/slug dynamically during signup process with React and Node? (Like the way Freshbooks does — i.e tenant1.domain.com, tenant2.domain.com, etc.)\n\n48:44 - Wes, I\'ve been taking your Mastering Gatsby course, and I\'m loving the course so far. My only complaint would be I wish you added a module for CSS. I think it\'s just because I personally struggle with styling websites. Do either of you have any suggestions on how I can improve in that aspect of web dev?\n\n50:35 - For web developers just starting out in freelancing/building e-commerce sites — from a business perspective, do you recommend we first 1) just code and worry about business stuff later? or 2) go through the government paperwork and be a sole proprietorship? or 3) incorporate (though this costs more)?\n\n54:20 - What\'s your approach for handling padding + margin with components?\n\n57:43 - How do you back up sensitive files that do NOT get added to source control (env files, for example)? I have off-site computer backups, and I have .env files on a small thumb drive on my keychain. What do you do?\n\n59:56 - Do you guys have stress management techniques? How do you cope with stressful situations at work, like unexpected tight deadlines?\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 002: Webcam and audio access with WebRTC and getUserMedia()](https://syntax.fm/show/002/webcam-and-audio-access-with-webrtc-and-getusermedia)\n* [Syntax 256: WebRTC and Peer-to-Peer Video Calling with Ian Ramzy](https://syntax.fm/show/256/webrtc-and-peer-to-peer-video-calling-with-ian-ramzy)\n* [Daily.co](http://daily.co) \n* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)\n* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\n* [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case)\n* [Master Gatsby](https://mastergatsby.com/)\n* [Syntax 292: How to Make Freelancing Easier](https://syntax.fm/show/292/how-to-make-freelancing-easier)\n* [https://github.com/formium/tsdx](https://github.com/formium/tsdx)\n* [https://nx.dev/react](https://nx.dev/react)\n* [https://github.com/lerna/lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-module-resolver)\n* [https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/)\n* [Deno](https://deno.land/)\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\n* [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)\n* [https://rocket.rs/](https://rocket.rs/)\n* [Syntax 290: Potluck - Is Angular good? × Stencil.js × Self XSS × SVGs in React × Social Platforms for Devs × Project Handoff × Cleaning Knives × More!](https://syntax.fm/show/290/potluck-is-angular-good-stencil-js-self-xss-svgs-in-react-social-platforms-for-devs-project-handoff-cleaning-knives-more)\n* [Modern CSS Layouts](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/modern-css-layouts)\n* [Modern CSS Design Systems](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/modern-css-design-systems)\n* [Digital Ocean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Eating Out Loud: Bold Middle Eastern Flavors for All Day, Every Day: A Cookbook](https://amzn.to/31JTjZQ)\n* Wes: [Levi\'s Barstow Western Shirt](https://rstyle.me/cz-n/enxwrncdguf) \n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Animating Svelte](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Black Friday Sale: Sign up for the year and save 50%!\n* Wes: [Master Gatsby](https://mastergatsby.com/) - Black Friday Sale: All courses 50% off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '23342fac07f8dcf1aa974356448c9a7adf233be70182af54640dbf35e9734b42', 'potluck-frameworks-vs-libraries-debugging-css-modules-vs-styled-components-resumes-stress-management-more', '/shows/304 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:06.953', '2023-10-27 15:57:56.485', 'TASTY'),

They seem pretty sweet, but I was curious, what does this mean for the world of web developers? Will my current apps slowly stop being supported? Will things like brew and node and npm still work on those new machines? Would it be smart to start learning new programs to be prepared for the transition?\n\n10:20 - Hey, great show! No really, great show. What is better for working at home/the office, iMac or MacBook Pro?\n\n13:25 - What are your thoughts on Remix? And has your listenership gone down since COVID-19? I have heard that less people listen to podcasts now because they no longer commute.\n\n19:33 - What is your approach to testing for e-commerce sites? I am about to launch a client\'s online store and I\'m sick with worry that a simple plugin upgrade will impact the store, and that I won\'t know about it till a disgruntled customer complains.\n\n24:57 - I’m getting into web development through college (just trying for an associate\'s to start) and I’m noticing the intro courses are very hard to get into. I’ve been self-teaching so I kind of feel like I’m ahead. The intro to computing logic (basic algorithms) teacher teaches very slowly and forces us to use an awful software called Raptor to create pseudo programs. I’ve been asking to actually use a language rather than the software but the teacher doesn’t have enough programming knowledge to grade the actual language assignments. I feel like this course is a step back from what I already know. I was just wondering if you guys have any tips on getting through the grueling “required” courses?\n\n31:04 - So it\'s been announced now that Sapper will never hit 1.0, and instead Svelte core functionality is being expanded and Sapper is being deprecated. I know you all don\'t have any inside info, but kind of wondering how Scott feels about this and what he\'s doing with his Sapper site in the nebulous time between the big announcement and the release of the next Svelte version?\n\n35:17 - I\'m currently working through a full-stack Udemy course to make the switch away from my day job to try freelance web development. I want to start taking on some easier freelance jobs to help make a little extra money and build my portfolio, and I see WordPress recommended as an easy way to do this. My question is, would it be worth undertaking the learning process to pick up some PHP and learn basic WordPress development so that I can start freelancing now, or would I be better served just focusing on HTML, CSS and JS and waiting until I broaden my understanding of these languages before I start taking on some preliminary clients?\n\n39:22 - If I plan to use WordPress as a headless CMS, how do I make sure the WordPress site itself is not publicly accessible? As far as I know, there\'s no \"API-only\" mode for WordPress (like there is for, say, Rails or Laravel) and if I install a WordPress site on a server, it\'s going to be discoverable online. I\'d hate to have people find the WordPress API site and think it was my website — or for my static site to have to compete with my WordPress API for prominence in search engines. How do people ensure this doesn\'t happen?\n\n42:01 - If I have a Vue.js website running on WordPress, how could I dynamically insert Vue components from the WordPress backend (e.g. have a post that inserts a Vue.js poll component)? I don\'t want to recompile every time.\n\n44:24 - I\'ve heard you mention previously that you have used WordPress to host sites in the past. I\'m keen to learn how you have created your own themes for those sites. Did you write your own PHP, etc, or is there another way? I\'m hoping to learn a bit more about developing for WordPress as it\'s a skill I\'d like to have in my back pocket, and would love to hear about any resources you would recommend for this.\n\n47:51 - I’ve been a web developer for over 15 years. Unfortunately, I had to leave web development for personal reasons. I have a lot of great skills. Unfortunately, because I’ve been out of the game for so long my resume is full of holes. All the current experience I have is project-based or freelance-based. I do not have the ability to show long-term projects or anything stable on my resume. I’m trying to get my first job back in the field after my long absence. It has proven to be nearly impossible. I am listening to your Tasty Treat about certifications and certified education. I agree that certifications do not show actual skill. I also agree that just because I do not have longevity and consistency on my resume that I do not have the skills to pay the bills. How can I get my first job back in the field? I am working on small projects to highlight my skills but no one really seems to care. What would you do?\n\n53:36 - I am currently in a food service job, but would love to move into the dev/design field. I have a year of experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/Sass, as well as React, Gatsby, Next, and Node ( thank you both for helping with those ). I have a small amount of experience with freelance web design and development, but feel I am greatly underselling myself ($150 for a Gatsby site built for a friend and less than $100 for a couple Fiverr gigs). I have seen freelance work out well for my friends and family, but I am terrified of having to find clients. I have a hard time valuing my work and fold when money is brought up.

I started web dev as a bartender/college dropout in 2017 when Syntax was pretty new. I rarely miss an episode, and this year I\'m starting my first >$100k JS job! Your show has always been fun, kept my attention in the realm of web dev, and helped guide my interest — I think it has been extremely valuable to my career so far, and I look forward to more.\n\n04:10 - How do I know when to pull in a package rather than write similar functionality myself? And is there a rule for when enough is enough, in terms of having too many packages? What I\'m most concerned about is bundle size. It doesn\'t seem to take a lot of packages before Webpack notifies you about large bundle sizes, so what would be best practice?\n\n11:27 - What is your opinion of doing a sponsored post or guest post on your own site? And if you\'re in favor, what sorts of terms, payment, etc. would you outline or charge for it? \n\n18:20 - Do you have/know of any resources for those that want to learn more about selling digital products through e-commerce? The sources I\'ve found (Scott\'s e-commerce/Gatsby courses & Next.js commerce demo page) focus more on creating stores that sell physical products. Are there any gotchas when selling digital vs physical?\n\n22:10 - Do you have any tips for keeping your skills up to date while taking a break from work? I’m a frontend dev currently six months into my year-long maternity leave and I feel like my brain has turned to soup. I listen to podcasts and read blog posts but it never feels like enough. Time and energy are very limited for me to work on personal projects!\n\n25:11 - I remember you guys saying something about making your own UI component libraries. Do you use some CSS libraries like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) or even [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or others for this, or do you write your Sass/CSS from scratch?\n\n30:52 - Would be interested to hear some of the common ways you use dev tools (chrome dev tools, react dev tools, redux, etc.). I feel like there is a lot of information in there that I am not utilizing properly to help figure out problems during development. Would be cool to hear an overview of how you use the different tabs, some of the most commons things to look for, etc.\n\n35:20 - I am graduating from a bootcamp next month and I feel severe insecurities/imposter. For whatever reason, I freeze up when it comes to coming up with code or writing things myself, mainly in JS. When in class, watching tutorials, following along, or viewing other people\'s code, I can tell you exactly what is going on, why it is being done, and I can change and add things and explain them. But when it comes to starting from a blank slate, I freeze, as if everything I know about programming has gone out the window. Do you have any advice as to how to get past this hurdle? I feel like at this point I shouldn\'t be feeling like this, but maybe this is normal?\n\n40:36 - Do you think developers have a responsibility to help reduce CO2 emissions caused by the web? A [BBC news article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55164410) stated that \"HD video streaming on a phone generates about eight times more in emissions than standard definition (SD)\" and noted that on a small screen, the viewer might not even notice the difference. Should the developer limit the resolution available to mobile devices, or should they let the end user choose?\n\n47:53 - I was hoping that you guys could give me, and other listeners, advice on \"knowing when you\'ve bitten off more than you can chew\"? Often I\'ll be working on a project for fun, or possibly building out my portfolio, and I\'ll continue to get excited about features that I\'d like to add to my current app or what have you. At first glance, the ideas or features seemed reasonable enough to tackle, but hours later, I\'ll find myself stuck, realizing that I\'m in over my head, as I\'ve tried to take on something that I\'m not yet experienced enough to work with, or I\'m lacking the man-power to complete it in a timely manner. At the same time, I want to challenge myself so that I can grow, but sometimes I feel that I\'m not using my time wisely. So my question to you is, where is the line between challenging ourselves to take on new and difficult tasks and scaling back our current work to make it more approachable and less overwhelming?\n\n55:01 - What is the right use-case for a database, and what is the right use-case for a headless CMS? Is a headless CMS just a database + a user-friendly way of entering data into that database? Is there a secure way of querying Sanity directly from the frontend if I have data that I want to be only available to logged-in users?\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax Listener Questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQlAo1wXHiJMySdU-h8QMtfoz92aMS9eycEHXB6eRCLh8KHA/viewform)\n* [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/)\n* [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)\n* [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/)\n* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)\n* [BEM](http://getbem.com/)\n* [Mux](https://mux.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Double Sided Mounting Tape](https://amzn.to/3qVAkX3)\n* Wes: [Secret Aardvark Habanero Hot Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Aardvark-Habanero-Sauce-Net/dp/B00AIR3Q38)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [All Courses](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '79d739cbd6f62cee16c322dfc51363d8265356d5dec69464b8758a2bf43a48a2', 'potluck-usd100k-dev-jobs-sponsored-blog-posts-how-to-keep-your-skills-up-to-date-libraries-vs-custom-dev-tools-more', '/shows/320 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:07.819', '2023-10-27 15:57:57.473', 'TASTY'),

A number? A custom type of show?\n  * Create a function: What params does it take? What type are they? What does it return?\n* Types allow your code to know if there are type errors that would present themselves to the user silently. These are small errors that can be compounded and go unnoticed.\n  * This can allow you to prevent shipping code that has these errors by checking your code.\n  * Some of the biggest benefits here come via errors in your text editor\n\n13:30 - Explaining the types\n* You can create your own types\n* Strings\n* Numbers\n  * We only have numbers in TS, no floats/ints\n  * We do have BigInt though, but not something most people will use\n* Arrays\n  * Will be a list of another type\n* Unions\n  * This type will be one of the possible options\n  * String of DRAFT PUBLISHED or ARCHIVED\n* Intersections\n  * An intersection type combines multiple types into one\n* Objects\n  * These are custom types where each property is its own type\n* Any\n  * Explicit any\n  * Implicit any\n* Language types\n  * These things are technically just Objects, but they have their own types\n  * Dates\n  * Timeouts\n  * DOM Elements / Nodes\n* Void\n  * When a function returns nothing — usually used with side effects like click handlers\n* Enum\n  * A set of named constants\n    * Used when you have a select amount of values — I like to think of these as the select lists of TS\n    * String unions are also used for this same thing\n\n30:28 - Inference\n* Automatic detection of types\n* Typescript will try to infer your types based on their definition\n* Not every type can be inferred, leading to implicit anys and the need for explicit types\n\n33:25 - Getting types\n* Most popular packages already have types — you install them like `npm i @types/whatever`\n* If a package doesn\'t have types, you have to create them yourself, which can be annoying\n  * [MakeTypes](https://jvilk.com/MakeTypes/)\n  * Console log a JSON.stringify(obj), and pipe it in\n* Node has types\n* Vanilla JS has types, for the language and all of the DOM - HTMLInputElement\n* React has types\n* Typing Node modules that don\'t have types\n\n### Overall benefits\n40:39 - Type hinting\n* With TS and your editor (VSCode) you\'ll get more information about your code as you type it — allowing you to know exactly what things expect\n  * This seems like a small deal but in practice leads to being much more efficient\n\n42:50 - Refactoring\n* Rename a function, type, or variable and it will be updated everywhere in the project!\n* Moving a function to a new file is actually part of TypeScript\n* Drag + Drop file, update imports\n\n48:10 - Compiling\n* [TSC](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) vs [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) / [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)\n* Only TSC type checks\n* Compiling TS with babel will not allow you to break the build on type errors, you\'ll need to run TSC in coordination or in the CI/CD\n\n## Links\n* [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/)\n* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)\n* [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott:\n  * 1: [LumiPets](https://amzn.to/3sfw4Cp)\n  * 2: [LumiPets Bear](https://amzn.to/2Lqkofk)\n* Wes: [Phomemo Label Printer](https://amzn.to/2LGXT5T)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [ESM & Snowpack](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '23ec615401f8ff7fea54bac9e76c5af4cd8a2e4a874fede5e7598f00b5ebaabc', 'typescript-fundamentals', '/shows/324 - typescript.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:30.024', '2023-10-27 15:57:57.693', 'TASTY'),

I am looking for an elegant way of reversing any promises that may have resolved before one was rejected. For instance, any db writes or 3rd-party webhooks that were created during the sign-up flow, but then need to be removed if one of the promises was rejected.\n\n04:51 - I\'ve been doing a bunch of client projects lately that use Gatsby with the WordPress API. I have the clients set up a hosting service for WordPress and a Netlify account connected to a GitHub repo on my account for Gatsby. What I\'m struggling with is the idea of having to keep these repos on my GitHub account for as long as these sites are live. But it doesn\'t seem all that sensible to have these non-technical clients also set up their own GitHub account that they grant me access to for building these projects. Do you have any suggestions?\n\n08:45 - Hey guys! Been listening to the podcast since I was starting out and it has been super helpful, entertaining, and hilarious. Two-part question. First, when would you consider a dev \"full-stack\"? I work for a small company that does WordPress, GraphQL, Node, React, TypeScript...lots of variety. I was hired as a front-end dev, but have since done work in PHP and Node, and even my boss has assured me I do full-stack work. However, I am not being paid as a full-stack dev. Can\'t figure out if this is because I work part-time (I have a baby) or some other reason. Should I be asking for a raise as a part-time employee?\n\n12:43 - When working freelance for a client, and you need to purchase something, for example the CPT UI plugin or something like WP Migrate DB Pro to help you build the site, do you either pay for it yourself and add it to the clients invoice at the end? Or do you ask them to pay for it when you need it? So many small \"gotchas\" I\'m needing to get over!\n\n18:02 - I just had a baby girl 4 months ago. When she is crying I sometimes catch myself trying to debug her to find out what is wrong. My wife thinks I am weird, but I guess I am just in the habit of trying to fix problems. Have you ever experienced this? \n\n22:17 - How do you prepare for the Monday and Wednesday podcast? What is it like, and what is the creative process behind it?\n\n29:03 - How would one go about using JavaScript to load all images from a folder in order to render them dynamically on a page? I looked around and only see answers using jQuery and PHP. In the end I want my client to be able to drop images into (or remove them from) the images folder and the site would just populate the image slider with all the images. Is this problem solvable with JavaScript, or is it time to learn something new?\n\n35:26 - I have a side project with a Node backend that sends out reminders to signed-up users about various deadlines that they opt-in to. It started out pretty small but as the user base is now in the thousands, I\'m worried that my reminder send functionality won\'t be able to keep up with the increasing volume. It\'s basically just a daily CRON job that loops through users and finds the different notifications to send out - either through Twilio or Postmark. Is there a more efficient way to perform large CRON jobs such as this? Curious how each of you guys would tackle this problem.	\n\n42:29 - Hey guys, great overview episode on Deno (ep 322). This got me thinking, again, of the proliferation of tools and technologies in our industry and ecosystems. Say we\'ve already \"identified\" the technology or tool and now we need to get familiar. As course designers constantly exploring new tools and technologies, what are some ways you can most efficiently and productively grasp actionable understanding (i.e. shortest route to Neo\'s \"I know kung-fu\")? And can you share any \"hacks\" or \"pro-tips\" that can help surmount that initial learning curve and tech-stack fatigue?\n\n## Links\n* [SnipCart](https://snipcart.com/)\n* [Syntax 228: More on Severless - Databases × Files × Secrets × Auth × More!](https://syntax.fm/show/228/more-on-severless-databases-files-secrets-auth-more)\n* [FileReader API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader)\n* [Syntax 322: The Deno Show](https://syntax.fm/show/322/the-deno-show)\n* [Syntax 044: How To Learn Things Quickly](https://syntax.fm/show/044/how-to-learn-new-things-quickly)\n* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)\n* [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/)\n* [Begin.com](https://begin.com/)\n* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)\n* [Syntax 035: Keeping Up with the Codeashians.

This is annoying for objects as I want to know what fields it contains! How do you handle this? Is there some VSCode magic to make it show the full type definition or is there some way to bring up the definition in the .d.ts file?\n\n04:55 - What techniques do you guys use to keep different tech stack requirements fresh between projects?\n\n10:35 - How do you feel about [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) vs. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)?

Can you elaborate on the differences in designing for a website and for a web app?\n\n25:46 - What\'s the difference between adaptive and responsive design?\n\n32:40 - Multi-vendor platforms? Have you done it before? A partner and I, are planning to build a peer-2-peer platform (similar to Etsy and Amazon, where users can register as a merchant or a buyer). What is the easiest way to make payment transactions (Stripe or PayPal)? Do you know any frameworks that will make my life easier?\n\n36:16 - Is there a golden rule for mutations? I\'ve been using GraphQL for last couple of months, and everything is great as long as I\'m just fetching data. When I need to write mutations, the story gets murky. Looking around internet, there are not too many best practices to be found - most of the articles and blogs focus on data fetching.\n\n42:19 - What do you think about the future of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)? I know they are replacing [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) with [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltekit), which uses [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). What direction do you think Svelte will go in?\n\n45:32 - How can I get back into a habit of learning new things and stop heavily relying on video tutorials all the time? I really struggle to sit down and read for long periods of time. Also have you guys came across the Genesis framework, and if so, could you recommend any learning material? Thanks.\n\n48:54 - My team uses [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates for generating newsletters. The content is coming from a CMS for generating final HTML. I\'m fairly new to handlebars and [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) syntax, so instead of learning handlebars I\'m thinking about using [React](https://reactjs.org/) to generate the html on server side. I see some great potential here as the entire team is well-versed with React.

We’ve also got an amazing selection of GraphQL tutorials at [hasura.io/learn](https://hasura.io/learn).\n\n## Show Notes\n01:51 - Overview\n* [Level Up](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/) uses a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) & secure cookie-based authentication and tracks sessions via a db table.\n* [Accounts.js](https://www.accountsjs.com/)\n\n05:13 - [JWT](https://jwt.io/)\n* Base 64 encoded (not encrypted) token that contains data. We have both `accessToken`s and `refreshToken`s.\n* JWT has three parts:\n  * Header\n    * What kind of algo was used\n  * Payload\n    * Data about the user\n    * Email\n    * Username\n    * UserID\n    * refreshToken, authToken, sessionId\n  * Signature\n    * This ensures that no one monkeyed with the above parts. If you change your email in the payload, the signature is not invalid, because in order to generate the signature, it uses the header and payload as part of it.\n* accessToken\n  * A short lived JWT that containsthe `sessionToken`, `userId` and expires after 90min.\n* refreshToken\n  * A long lived JWT that contains just the `sessionToken` and doesn\'t expire.\n* JWT can be decoded and read, but you have to encode them with your secret. \n* JWT can be stored anywhere, there are two main places:\n\n20:26 - Cookies\n* We use httpOnly, secure cookies to store the accessToken and the refreshToken. The accessToken is a session cookie and is removed whenever the browser is closed. The refreshToken is valid for 100 days but is also re-created and revalidated for 100 more days each time the accessToken is generated.\n* Because these are httpOnly cookies, they cannot be accessed by JavaScript in the client and can only be set and removed on the server.\n* Note: Safari has stricter rules than others for same domain cookies (e.g. `localhost` won\'t work).\n\n34:26 - Sessions\n* Sessions are when a user logs in on a device. If you open a phone and log in and a computer and log in, those will create two different sessions. A session contains information about the user\'s connection (like their IP) but it also contains the userId which allows us to create new accessTokens from a valid session.\n* Sessions can be valid or invalid. This allows us to log anyone out by setting their session to valid: false.\n* Sessions also have `sessionToken` which are generated on authentication or create account.\n\n38:10 - [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\n* Cross-origin-resource-sharing\n* Can be super tricky to get working cross-domain\n* You usually have to actually visit the website for the cookie to be set, even with lax cors\n\n46:06 - [CSRF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF)\n\n48:47 - Authentication process\n* [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)\n\n52:13 - Helper Packages\n* [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) is super easy\n* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/)\n* [auth0](https://auth0.com/)\n\n## Links\n* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)\n* [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [reMarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2)\n* Wes: [Opration Odessa](https://www.netflix.com/title/80202236)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Node Fundamentals Authentication](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '03f2f99422430c9c248052b309b6fa9a6223b6b577ec04ed90cdaf0ec9b22d89', 'how-to-build-your-own-auth', '/shows/336 - auth.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:30.840', '2023-10-27 15:57:58.408', 'TASTY'),

I would have to watch YouTube tutorials or look at other people’s code in order to implement simple features to my website and I’ve been feeling pretty stupid for not spending the time to think of it. I feel like I’m missing out on knowing how to problem solve for myself whenever I copy other people’s code and try to understand them afterwards.\n\n19:27 - I just landed my first web development job after following The Odin Project and building personal projects for about a year. It tripled my income so I am incredibly excited! I have been using a PHP framework which was developed by one of my coworkers and has no documentation. In order to understand the code, I either have to read a bunch of source code or ask one of the other developers questions. While I am doing well, I can\'t help but feel as if I am working way too slow and asking way too many questions. I assume this is imposter syndrome and lots of people deal with it, but how would you suggest dealing with this type of anxiety?\n\n25:11 - Monorepos, yes or no?\n\n29:43 - As a brand new self-taught web developer, how would you know if you\'re ready to apply for junior positions?\n\n32:03 - Will there ever be a .eat domain or are the pre-order sites just ripping you off? Would like to know who decides what TLDs are possible or not.\n\n35:26 - I\'m currently employed as a fullstack developer but want to build a portfolio for future job hunting. Would you say it\'s ok to reference a project or two from an employer? My problem is that the only projects I have outside are mostly just smaller tools built for myself for fun.\n\n39:29 - Should developers always use their real first and last name when presenting themselves as a professional online (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, Github, personal site). Or is it acceptable to use a fake last name for example? My wife is quite conscious about privacy online, so would prefer I retain some anonymity. But also, my last name is a bit generic, and not very Googleable. I thought having a more snappy and interesting name would help me stand out, and be easier to find with a quick Google. You guys both have awesome names that are very unique and are hard to forget.\n\n43:59 - How do you find time to work and keep up with updates and libraries etc. having a wife & kids?\n\n46:06 - I am a beginner in making course content. I am trying to create a programming tutorial, but every time I try to record some tutorials I have to compromise on audio quality. Lots of background noises get captured on audio. Can you both share some tips to make soundproofing room? What tricks do you both use?\n\n53:33 - As someone who recently learned/is learning how to build websites using express/node/react, with a little know how with Python and Django too, how do you start building a portfolio that isn\'t just a bunch of practice/show-pieces? How do I get a client?\n\n59:53 - Should I be using multiple web apps on a single site or try to make them all one? If I have a site that displays blog posts about parks for example, then a page with all the parks listed out that link to a page about each single park\'s details, should I be making the entire thing in one app? Or make a blog app and publish it, then make a different app for the other content and publish it using a subdomain?\n\n## Links\n* [Syntax 266: Video for the Web 2020 and Beyond](https://syntax.fm/show/266/video-for-the-web-2020-and-beyond)\n* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)\n* [Mux](https://mux.com/)\n* [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/)\n* [LesMills](https://www.lesmills.com/us/)\n* [Bitmovin](https://bitmovin.com/)\n* [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com/en/)\n* [Wista](https://wistia.com/) \n* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)\n* [AWS MediaLive](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/)\n* [Keystone.js](https://www.keystonejs.com/)\n* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)\n* [Syntax 331: Hasty Treat - Hireable Skills for 2021](https://syntax.fm/show/331/hasty-treat-hireable-skills-for-2021)\n* [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/)\n* [dbx 286s](https://www.amazon.com/dbx-286s-Microphone-Channel-Processor/dp/B004LWH79A/)\n* [Electro-Voice RE20](https://www.amazon.com/Electro-Voice-RE20-Broadcast-Microphone-Variable-D/dp/B00KCN83V8/)\n* [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [CamLink 4k](https://amzn.to/3qq5AvF)\n* Wes: [TS80p Mini Soldering Iron](https://amzn.to/38jAGiq)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Node Fundamentals Authentication](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Fullstack Advanced React & GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '5363d0c075c767591d203db324effee7a8a52be58ed1cb2bee116b06005791b2', 'potluck-video-hosting-fake-names-portfolio-projects-monorepos-apis-tlds-recording-tips-more', '/shows/342 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:31.133', '2023-10-27 15:57:58.789', 'TASTY'),

My hope is to write them in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), host them somewhere and then automatically feed them into my website so they are all formatted to the style of my website.\n\n05:37 - Do you care if people share cool, unique tips from your courses publicly on social media? For example, I once shared out a trick from one of Wes\' courses for how to set your [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) windows different colors to distinguish your server and client code windows (giving all credit to Wes\' course for the concept). But it felt a little weird that I was sharing out a portion of his paid content for free. Is that okay? Where\'s the line?\n\n08:18 - With official support of [IE11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_11) coming to an end on August 17, 2021, do you think developers should still try to support ir or focus only on new modern browsers? Also, will there be a new \"lowest common denominator\" that we should be aware of and support?\n\n17:20 - Thanks for an awesome podcast! Have you looked into [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) (not to be confused with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)) for backend work? It is an open source TypeScript Node framework that is becoming pretty popular\n\n22:48 - Do you think it’s worth learning [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) for freelancing if you aren’t too confident in your JavaScript front-end design? Also, I don’t want to get stuck in only WordPress land just because of the money.\n\n30:11 - Hi guys, I have been listening to you guys for a while and just recently launched my first website! Your podcast has been a huge help in terms of getting started. For the website I made, I tested the iPhone view on Chrome dev tools and everything looked fine. However, when viewing the website on an actual iPhone, the button is too small and the word \"Menu\" turns into \"Men\". Any advice on how to more accurately test sites on mobile devices without pushing to a production branch?\n\n36:52 - Do you guys ever see your premium courses pirated on sites like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/), any of the other video course platforms? Meaning somebody downloaded your videos and uploaded them as if they were the creator. Any tips to protect against this?\n\n39:53 - Looking at [uses.tech](http://uses.tech/) and thinking, I see a lot of class names with almost the same style, gKxjCc and hSiXhL. I really want to know the science behind generating those. Do you have a shared classes that some magic tool transfers them into ugly names and copies over? What is that tool? And is it worth it?	\n\n42:57 - Have you ever developed a .edu site? If so, what did you use to manage the enormous archives in addition to giving the site a simple page builder for departments to contribute with little or no interaction from the developer? No Joomla or Drupal please - been there. Thanks for the great help guys!\n\n50:35 - Hi Wes & Scott, thank you so much for giving me my weekly motivation boost to try out new stuff. Currently, I am experimenting with Next.js and SSG and I would like to know how I can generate a page at build time but only show it to an authorized user. I know I could use SSR with getServerSideProps to check allowance, however, the page is completely static without any dynamic content and I don’t want to regenerate it with every request. Is there a way to achieve this? Keep up the great work.\n\n54:59 - I love the show guys! I want to make the transition into full-time freelancing and wanted to know what you think about having a talk with my current employer to see if they\'d be willing to take me from full-time to a contract/freelance basis. Bad idea? Thoughts?

If you wanted to work remotely as a freelancer, however, is that really applicable advice? Is it viable to work 100% remote and not be tied to \"local rates\"? \n\nHow can I leverage my years of professional experience when starting to freelance? A lot of material online speaks to those who are learning web development for the first time. But what does someone do if they\'ve been working at big companies, who can\'t share their work directly? What can I do to help prospective clients appreciate those years of experience?\n\n06:02 - In your opinion, what is the accepted norm for the size of a component? It could be anything from a single element to a full page of content, but what is the norm for component size or content? Love the show, keep up the good work.\n\n09:42 - I\'m a bit confused about throttling and debounce. What is the difference between them? I have been finding different examples which are not at all helpful.\n\n12:58 - My question is about climbing the company hierarchy. I\'ve had a hard time getting my first job after graduation. I have dealt with the unemployment office, useless recruiters, trying to look important for companies, and I wonder if a get a low wage job at a company and then apply for their IT department after some time if there is a open position. Is it bad practice or good strategy taking this shortcut? Would they know what I\'m trying to accomplish?\n\n18:25 - I\'m getting started building websites and find the initial design to be a challenge. I always end up diving into the coding and then spending hours getting lost tweaking CSS. The mediocrity of the final design is a masked technical challenge, and I emerge at the other end of the effort with something I\'m still not happy with. I suspect there is some kind of mock up stage I\'m forgoing, and I bet there are some tools to make it easier. I imagine that some kind of application that really focused me on the design and made it easy to tweak and tinker quickly would be ideal. Thoughts? What do you use?\n\n23:34 - The company I work for works with a SOAP API. Currently I am developing a application in React but I am wondering whether it\'s better to use the SOAP API or let them create a Rest API. Some people on the internet say that JS and SOAP combinations are not done. Is there some advice you can give me about this?\n\n28:28 - Why are radio buttons called radio buttons?\n\n30:49 - I am midway through a post-baccalaureate in computer science. I recently quit my job to focus on my second degree. Now I\'m looking to spend my \"extra time\" on an area of focus that can hit as many of the following criteria as possible:\n* Could make me money now\n* Help me to hit the ground running when I graduate\n* Get me a job easily\n* Make me all kinds of cash \n\nThoughts?\n\n35:56 - What is your opinion on a Rust GraphQL server for web backend? Do you think it is better than Node.js?\n(not part of a question, just a comment: I found you yesterday and dude I have to say, you are legendary... I am 13 right now and also started web development when I was 12. I have been looking for a good web-development related podcast for about four months now. Looks like I found the one I needed ;) )\n\n39:57 - How would you go about introducing React into an existing big website with lots of legacy code and a template-based CMS behind? I can\'t do a full rewrite but I would love to start turning little bits & pieces into a single-page-experience (e.g. checkout) to slowly modernize the site. The frontend is already TypeScript & SCSS but it\'s an old self-made framework and the content coming from the CMS is mostly put into data-attributes or right into the HTML. I don\'t really have an API for most of the content. How would React hook into the existing DOM in different places, loading data from the templates and potentially writing it back into the templates as well?\n\n45:31 - What\'s the best way to be able to host personal projects (frontend + backend) for *free* on the web? I would like something where I can SSH into to install for example Node.js and a database. I already bought a domain, but I don\'t want to pay for some premium plan for now since I\'m short on money and it\'s for personal projects anyway.\n\n## Links\n* [https://type-scale.com](https://type-scale.com/)\n* [https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/modern-css-design-systems](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/modern-css-design-systems)\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/soap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/soap)\n* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)\n* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)\n* [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)\n* [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)\n* [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Wyze Sprinkler Controller](https://amzn.to/3ghvSiD)\n* Wes: [Retevis](https://amzn.to/3wR4T3a) \n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott:\n  1: [Become a Level Up Tutorials Author](https://forms.gle/PDEpDAGZpNHBDVou5)\n  2: [Github Actions with Brian Douglas](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '57d8cbd205d69a98e011441481ff07a7c85f36c7aeeca88ca4cc7bfb6f60888a', 'potluck-freelancing-leveraging-your-experience-component-size-dealing-with-mediocrity-how-to-spend-extra-time-rust-vs-node-free-hosting-more', '/shows/352 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:31.619', '2023-10-27 15:57:59.331', 'TASTY'),

This could be something like the current disk usage on your computer, or a temperature measurement (within a defined range).\n* `<marquee>`\n\n32:12 - Visual vs Semantic tags\n* Almost all tags in HTML are semantic\n* `<i>` vs `<em>` and `<bold>` vs `<strong>`\n  * `<i>` and `<bold>` are NOT deprecated like many have said\n  * The `<strong>` element is for content that is of greater importance, while the <b> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it\'s more important.\n\n35:40 - HTML tags with no meaning:\n* `<div>`\n* `<span>`\n\n37:51 - Some elements have special functionality or styling\n* `<details>` and `<summary>` tag\n* `<fieldset>` + `<legend>`\n\n40:59 - What elements would we like to see?\n* Modal element\n  * [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)\n* Textarea that grows with content\n* Animated accordion\n* A better table\n  * One that works with grid/flex/modern CSS, auto-sizing, max/min widths\n* From Twitter:\n  * VirtualList\n  * Carousel - HOT DRAMA\n  * Date range\n  * Hero\n  * <H> tag that figured its level out by itself.

JSX.Element\n* FC or FunctionComponent\n* It\'s discouraged for this reason: `It means that all components accept children, even if they\'re not supposed to`\n* It could be useful for a return type\n\n12:13 - Props\n* Default props:\n  ```jsx\n  const defaultJoke: JokeProps = {\n      joke: \'LOL JOE\',\n      id: \'YEAH\',\n      status: 200,\n  };\n  \n  function JokeItem({ joke = defaultJoke }: JokeProps): JSX.Element {\n      return (\n      <li>\n          {joke.joke} = {joke.id}\n      </li>\n      );\n  }\n  ```\n* Because props are always destructured, you often have to make a new type for your props. You can\'t just type each argument by itself.\n\n18:38 - State\n* Just like Generics, State can be inferred\n* If your type is simple and you\'re using useState, it just works:\n`const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);`\n\n22:27 - useEffect\n* Nothing special required\n* Good use of void: If you want to use a Promise function but not worry about await or .then(), you can pop a void in front of it:\n```jsx\nuseEffect(() => {\nconsole.log(\'Mounted\');\n// getJoke().then(console.log).catch(console.error);\nvoid getJoke();\n}, [getJoke]);\n```\n\n26:09 - Refs\n* Very similar to state however some interesting things with null:\n`const ref1 = useRef<HTMLElement>(null!);`\n* \"Instantiating the ref with a current value of null but lying to TypeScript that it\'s not null.\"\n\n29:33 - Custom Hooks\n* This is a great use case for Tuples\n\n31:00 - Context\n* This is probably the most complex thing in this list\n* First define the types\n* Use generic to pass in types OR null\n* This can also be non-null if you have default values in createContext:\n`const AppCtx = React.createContext<AppContextInterface | null>(null);`\n\n35:21 - Events\n* The React events system is better than Vanilla JS\n* Can handle them inline and have it inferred: `onClick={e ⇒ yeah(e.target)}`\n```jsx\nconst onSetType = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) =>\n    setType(e.target.value)\n```\n* React has a bunch of events built in — many of them take a Generic argument so you can specify the type of element that triggered it. Handy for native API methods like play and pause.\n\n39:27 - ForwardRef\n* Again use of <> to pass in forwarded ref type as param 1, Props types as param 2:\n```jsx\ntype Props = { children: React.ReactNode; type: \"submit\" | \"button\" };\nexport type Ref = HTMLButtonElement;\nexport const FancyButton = React.forwardRef<Ref, Props>((props, ref) => (\n  <button ref={ref} className=\"MyClassName\" type={props.type}>\n    {props.children}\n  </button>\n));\n```\n\n41:30 - ESLint\n* Typescript-react is good\n* Extend your own\n* Most JS rules apply to TS\n\n46:20 - React as Global React 17\n\n- Also add JSX: True to eslint globals for typing things like JSX.Element\n- global.d.ts\n\n```jsx\nimport * as react from \"react\"\nimport * as react_dom from \"react-dom\"\n\ndeclare global {\n    type React = typeof react\n    type ReactDOM = typeof react_dom\n}\n```\n\n48:08 - TSConfig\n* `jsx: \"react\"`\n* React emit .js files with JSX changed\n* Preserve .jsx file output\n* React-native → .js files with jsx not changed\n\n53:05 - Frameworks?\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) makes this a TREAT\n* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) just use .tsx extensions\n  * [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-ts-config/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-ts-config/)\n\n## Links\n* [https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react)\n* [Tanner Linsley](https://tannerlinsley.com/)\n* [https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)\n* [Deno](https://deno.land/)\n* [Architect](https://arc.codes/)\n* [https://fav.farm/](https://fav.farm/)\n* [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)\n* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)\n* [Parcel 2](https://v2.parceljs.org/)\n* [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)\n* Wes: [Folding Allen Keys](https://amzn.to/3nHjqKu) \n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott:\n  * 1: [Level Up Tutorials Pro Spring Sale](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - 50% off annual subscriptions!\n  * 2: [SvelteKit Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro)\n* Wes: [Beginner Javascript Course](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', 'f4d5d7891435610583133069a246a71ab98357f60773fefc537033e3f7f26533', 'react-typescript', '/shows/358 - react-typescript.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:31.847', '2023-10-27 15:57:59.651', 'TASTY'),

Having worked with redux in the past, IMMUTABILITY was a concept ingrained in my head. I continue to see benefits of immutable updates across all sorts of libraries, frameworks, vanilla js, etc. Learning about GraphQL now, I\'m taken aback by the fact that CUD (create, update, delete) operations are called MUTATIONS. Is there a reason that we use the \"mutation\" terminology, despite the fact that best practices dictate that we should implement immutable updates to objects? Does GraphQL actually mutate objects behind the scenes?\n\n06:38 - How do you sleep at night?!? I mean, how do you switch off your brain when you\'re trying to go to sleep and your brain just wants to keep on coding?\n\n12:15 - How do you manage copy and microcopy on a site? Should you put every piece of text across the entire site into a CMS so the client can change it? Or just the parts you think may be updated in the future? Or do you just hard-code everything directly into the markup? Or collect it all into an importable JSON file?\n\n21:41 - I am new to using CMSs and I was wondering for applications that require a lot of content management where a CMS or headless CMS such as Contentful is ideal but also requires dynamic queries such as recommended content to the end-user based on browsing history. How do you approach integrating the user data in combination with the data being received and handled from the CMS? A separate API and database? Or is this a scenario that a CMS doesn\'t fit? \n\n25:56 - When solving a problem, do you do it through trial and error? Or do you carefully think through every solution and choose the best one before actually implementing it into code?	\n\n28:14 - How can we take advantage of this new partnership between 1Password + SecretHub! I feel like this is getting into DotEnv but sounds so much more interesting.\n\n32:34 - When creating types in TypeScript, when should someone use a type over an interface? While I generally understand the differences, it seems like interfaces offer more flexibility. I am struggling to understand why I would ever use a type.\n\n36:34 - I\'ve recently started using TypeScript in React, and typically I\'m just using function components. I\'ve seen some people saying that classes are really great with TypeScript in React but I haven\'t found any real use case/benefits myself yet. How about you guys, do you use classes in React/TypeScript?\n\n38:17 - What are your opinions on generators like Yeoman?\n\n44:26 - I\'ve been looking for a career in web for a couple of years now and I\'ve recently landed a job with a small agency getting paid hourly making WordPress websites, that I\'ll be starting in two weeks. I\'m worried that I\'m going to get stuck pushing Divi sites all the time. I know this is a good opportunity for me but I was hoping you guys can shed some light and give me some tips on how I can put my skills to good use.\n\n48:35 - What are your approaches for caching a GraphQl API?\n\n52:30 - You mentioned in an earlier Potluck that Svelte is probably the easiest framework to learn. How confident can one be to start a new project with Svelte? Being a technical lead, can I propose our team to work with Svelte? Are there enough material/solution on the web and is the community established?\n\n## Links\n* [ZMA Supplement](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/zma-supplements)\n* [Tina](https://tina.io/)\n* [https://twitter.com/gusfune/status/1372243283758419977](https://twitter.com/gusfune/status/1372243283758419977)\n* [1Password](https://1password.com/)\n* [SecretHub](https://secrethub.io/)\n* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n* [Syntax 348: TypeScript Fundamentals — Getting a Bit Deeper](https://syntax.fm/show/348/typescript-fundamentals-getting-a-bit-deeper)\n* [Syntax 042: Potluck EP × Vue.js × Headless WP × Typescript & Flow × Productivity × Server Side Rendering × Yeoman](https://syntax.fm/show/042/potluck-ep-vue-js-headless-wp-typescript-and-flow-productivity-server-side-rendering-yeoman)\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/zx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zx)\n* [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)\n* [Mercurius](https://mercurius.dev)\n* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)\n* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Contigo Shake & Go](https://amzn.to/33sKd42)\n* Wes: [Deli Containers](https://amzn.to/3kSQmxh)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott:\n  * 1: [Become a Level Up Tutorials Author](https://forms.gle/PDEpDAGZpNHBDVou5)\n  * 2: [Level Up Tutorials Pro Spring Sale](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - 50% off annual subscriptions!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets\n', '1dfec93de7c907367c2873558fb5c3fb365077143a13b8276095b2eeb8d70acc', 'potluck-immutability-turning-off-your-brain-types-vs-interfaces-hooks-vs-components-making-the-most-of-your-first-job-confidence-in-svelte-more', '/shows/360 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:31.909', '2023-10-27 15:57:59.765', 'TASTY'),

As a newcomer to web development it\'s all a little expensive for me to mimic what you have; at least before I\'ve learned enough to justify investing in better equipment. My question is: what are the minimum specs (laptop/monitor/etc) you would recommend a beginner just starting out in webdev?\n\n22:35 - I rarely, if ever, hear you guys or any other web dev related podcast mentioned Python, Flask, Django etc. Do you have any experience with those frameworks and can you give any thoughts you may have on Python as a language for back end development.\n\n26:47 - What do you think of using Docker containers to do development work? I have seen a couple articles talking about it, but it doesn\'t seem super common to use since few GitHub projects have Dockerfiles in their repos. \n\n32:19 - I\'ve often heard you two talk about the idea of the \"golden handcuffs\", where a job pays well, but the employees are miserable. I think I might be in that situation right now. I\'ve tried organizing my day so my time is better segmented. I can\'t tell if this is the natural progression of a developer advancing in their career and I just need to adjust better, or if I need to make a change. Any advice or tips you have to better manage time or decide what\'s next would be much appreciated.\n\n37:28 - When it comes to desktop browser testing, is there a difference anymore is browser rendering engines? Do most (if not all) browsers use Google\'s rendering engine?\n\n39:20 - As someone who got into the industry relatively recently (around 2019), component frameworks and single-page applications were my introduction to web development. I am now really interested in learning more about the \"traditional\" way of doing things, 100% server-rendered. What\'s my recourse here? Ruby on Rails, Laravel, something else? Is there an agreed upon \"modern\" way to do a server-rendered monolithic app?\n\n43:43 - I wish to ask the kind of plug-in, extensions or stand-alone software you use for code prediction and to help you code faster. I personally use Kite and VS Code\'s intellisense, it seems to get it wrong more times than right. Do both of you have any recommendation?\n\n47:18 - Is there any benefit to using prop types in TypeScript for React projects?\n\n48:14 - I\'m currently planning to build an audio-focused app (maybe even more than one actually), and I\'ve been wondering how you would solve the problem of storing and fetching (on-demand) hundreds, perhaps thousands, of little audio-files. I\'ve got some deep reservations against AWS, although I\'m somewhat familiar with it - the complexity, hidden (and hard to estimate) costs etc. I\'m thinking about Digital Ocean or something like that. Would it be too hard to implement things like caching and such yourself. Any thoughts?\n\n## Links\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-webcomponent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-webcomponent)\n* [https://medium.com/dev-channel/a-netflix-web-performance-case-study-c0bcde26a9d9](https://medium.com/dev-channel/a-netflix-web-performance-case-study-c0bcde26a9d9)\n* [LearnNode.com](https://learnnode.com/)\n* [Transistor.fm](https://transistor.fm/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [A Death In Cryptoland Podcast](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-podcasts/904-a-death-in-cryptoland)\n* Wes: [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Svelte Kit](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner JavaScript Notes](https://wesbos.com/javascript)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '99dcc27622243f335f756ae62ecc84aa44fd3bfd079053dbac32d6c4fe9704b2', 'potluck-web-components-gear-docker-web-dev-frameworks-golden-handcuffs-browser-testing-ssr-react-code-prediction-more', '/shows/364 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:32.238', '2023-10-27 15:58:00.057', 'TASTY'),

Does the improved devEx makes up for the small (but growing) community and lack of libraries? Do you think svelte-next is here to stay or maybe we will get a revamp that breaks backward compatibility in a couple of years, like svelte 2 -> svelte 3?\n\n8:48 - Git question: My process is often that I want to be able to use my last project as a starting point for my next project, with the new project having absolutely no connection or relationship to the old project. What steps can I take to completely sever any ties to the old project? Bonus question: In the new project I would love to eliminate all commits from the old project and start the new project having just one commit, the initial commit with all the code from the old project.	\n\n11:05 - Is CRA still useful for building actual production-level web apps these days? People seem to be reaching for Next or Gatsby most of the time, and I feel CRA is mainly used for actually learning React/building personal small websites. Your thoughts? Also, for normal CSR, I feel it is better to use something like Next, and fetch data inside your component (eg: for a dashboard) rather than building one with CRA. Am I wrong?\n\n19:40 - What are your favorite screencast tools? (Linux? Mac? Windows?)\n\n25:53 - Is it a bad trait for beginners to “give up” easily? By that, I mean instead of taking the time to think of the answer to a problem, they would instead rely on googling the solution and try to understand how it worked afterward.\n\n27:55 - In pursuit of better health I want to track my weight daily using a smart digital scale. The idea is to automate the process of logging my own weight (e.g. stepping on the scale will update my Apple Health and any other integrations I have). After some searching around I landed on the Aria Air (mostly because I like the design and it has the coolest name). One small problem - it does not sync with Apple Health as it is a product from FitBit. They have an API so I\'m thinking about running a serverless function daily, around 8 a.m. after I weigh in, to hit the FitBit API, get the data and push it to Apple Health. This way I can stay in the Apple eco-system whilst happily getting this nice, aesthetic digital scale. Any thoughts on how you would personally implement something like this? P.S. My girlfriend thinks I\'m crazy, but I know the tinkerer inside Wes will love this.\n\n30:26 - I work for the government with good pay and benefits and love where I work, but I feel like I’m missing out. Working in government we are not always working on the bleeding edge of technology. I do try and learn on my own, but it’s hard sometimes if I don’t put it into practice. I do peek at other job openings and get excited about the tech stack and the things they\'re doing. I\'m just afraid if I leave I won’t have the stability and benefits I would get from working in government. Any tips or thoughts would be appreciated.\n\n34:24 - Unpopular opinion: Authentication isn\'t that hard, but authorization is! What systems have you built to handle when users with specific permissions are allowed (or disallowed) to take actions within your system? What advice would you give to other developers developing permissions-based APIs, assuming their users can have 5-10 different levels of permissions?	\n\n40:21 - What are your thoughts on ReScript as an alternative to TypeScript?	\n\n44:43 - How come you guys moved to two sponsors on a Hasty and three on a Tasty? Not that it\'s a big deal - was just curious of it was to keep up with costs or just because you could and then you’d make more? Either way, the show is awesome and really appreciate your opinions on everything!\n\n48:01 - Have you tried Angular 12? I’d think you’d be pleasantly surprised if you gave it a chance!\n\n52:20 - I have to copy and paste hundreds of products with six rows of details from a spreadsheet into a web interface because there is no API or CSV upload function for this program. Any recommendation on how to automate data entry into web inputs, navigate pages / click buttons, and toggle between applications? BTW, I scored my first web developer job and have to give you guys credit for steering me in the right direction.\n\n## Links\n* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\n* [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)\n* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)\n* [iShowU](https://shinywhitebox.com/)\n* [Descript](https://www.descript.com/)\n* [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/)\n* [Aria Air](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/scales/aria-air)\n* [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/home)\n* [Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/ios/health/)\n* [https://www.gov.uk/](https://www.gov.uk/)\n* [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/)\n* [rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/)\n* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n* [Angular](https://angular.io/)\n* [Syntax 359: Hasty Treat - Making a Vaccine Bot with JavaScript](https://syntax.fm/show/359/hasty-treat-making-a-vaccine-bot-with-javascript)\n* [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)\n* [uses.tech](https://uses.tech)\n* [wes.tech](https://wes.tech)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)\n* Wes: [Wyze Sprinkler Controller](https://wyze.com/wyze-sprinkler.html)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Svelte Components Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '826995b60fbd6a76441c13b022f4794c68ae953dff286a89bfe777259c4e102c', 'potluck-svelte-bleeding-edge-tech-git-process-screencasts-government-jobs-permissions-based-apis-rescript-more', '/shows/372 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:32.670', '2023-10-27 15:58:00.453', 'TASTY'),

I’m tired of 1-5 page freelance WordPress sites. I love front-end coding and design. Do I need to “sell” people on static sites or are there freelance jobs out there for Vue/React/whatever static sites for developers? I want to stick with small businesses and a few other niches, but I’m tired of drag-and-drop builders in WordPress. Plus, I feel WordPress is overkill for a majority of sites. I just want to code sites and freelance.\n\n08:53 - I wanted to get your opinion on 3rd-party cloud services that provide some application functionality. Things like auth0, Algolia, open cart etc. I work for a large enterprise where there is a real fear of trusting these companies with our data and so everything is built from the ground up, with less time, and we miss out on some of the sweet features these services provide. Do you use many services like this in your production apps and how would you decide which to use?\n\n16:03 - I recently took Wes’ Advanced React course and went on to build my first custom React app! Thanks Wes! When the time came to deploy the app, I was surprised by the asymmetry in hosting options for the front vs. backend. It seems that there are 1000 slick, free-teir options for hosting my front-end. But finding a host for my Keystone backend: barf. I messed around with Heroku but troubleshooting was a nightmare, and I eventually settled on a Digital Ocean droplet. My inner system admin is secretly happy to have another OS instance to manage, but I hate paying 5 dollars a month to host a silly project that will probably never be seen by anyone, and I’m already irritated with the amount of care and feeding the backend needs. What gives? Why are there so many choices for frontend hosts and so few for the backend? Are there hosted backends that have auth, database, image hosting, etc and take care of the nitty-gritty with a newbie-friendly free-tier? Maybe I should I be looking into serverless?\n\n23:21 - Since Drupal has evolved beyond awkward kloog of v7 entity/ctools/json-services/phptemplate erc into v9 with excellent graphql/json/rest support and tomb(?) for non drupal web would you recommend Drupal as for a blogger/businesses\' internal network doc/publishing/communications system (ie Drupal not as website itself)?	\n\n29:43 - I have just started my web development freelancing business and I feel like I am having a hard time getting a lot of response from small business who currently don\'t even have a website (or have a terrible one). Is there any advice you can give about talking people into hiring a web developer when they CLEARLY need help? I plan to use NextJS and Sanity for all of my sites. My first client project is already built using it and it was a great developer experience!\n\n34:30 - What would you guys consider the best alternative to the BEM naming convention? I personally follow a method with very few classes (I\'ve seen this called GPS) which takes advantage of the CSS cascade, but I do think it may suffer from readability problems if I handed my stuff to another developer to work on. Interested to hear your thoughts.\n\n39:16 - I have been self teaching myself web development for a little over a year now and your show has been a big help! I am getting to the point now where I feel I am nearly qualified for jobs and will be starting the application journey soon. I currently work in supply chain management at a big corporation with a background in industrial engineering (of which I hold a Bachelors degree). My question for you is - seeing that I have work experience at a big company and a STEM background, do you think this holds any weight in terms of being qualified for a dev job? What I am mainly wondering is how much I should leverage this during interviews and on my resume.\n\n## Links\n* [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)\n* [https://tina.io/](https://tina.io/)\n* [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)\n* [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)\n* [https://circleci.com/](https://circleci.com/)\n* [https://github.com/Nexedi/renderjs](https://github.com/Nexedi/renderjs)\n* [https://keystonejs.com/](https://keystonejs.com/)\n* [https://www.drupal.org/](https://www.drupal.org/)\n* [https://medium.com/@jescalan/bem-is-terrible-f421495d093a](https://medium.com/@jescalan/bem-is-terrible-f421495d093a)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [I Was There Too Podcast](https://www.earwolf.com/show/i-was-there-too/)\n* Wes: [Mattias Random Stuff YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L2ef1CP-yw)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Advanced Svelte Techniques](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '8c4d9aa01ddc905cead00731ff18a608276630372ece1c97aadd85bf1e21d54e', 'potluck-wordpress-3rd-party-cloud-services-backend-hosting-drupal-getting-clients-gps-vs-bem-more', '/shows/376 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.008', '2023-10-27 15:58:00.774', 'TASTY'),

When you apply one style to something, you need to learn how to target things appropriately. This is a huge part of being good at CSS.\n  * People develop systems like BEM to organize this\n  * General rules - Use elements for base styling and classes for specific styling. Don\'t use IDs for styling.\n  * `!important` exists to override everything, but as a general rule, NEVER use it. Seriously.\n* Some interaction\n  * Most interaction is done in JavaScript, but CSS has some basics\n    * hover, active, focus\n* Pseudo selectors\n* You\'ll often see people reaching for libraries to make CSS easier and more consistent\n  * Common examples are Bootstrap, Foundation, and TailwindCSS\n  * For the most part you\'ll want to avoid these until you have a good understanding of the cascade, how CSS works, and how to write good CSS.\n* In addition to properties, you can now write your own custom properties for CSS.\n  * While this could be seen as an advanced technique, I believe the new normal is CSS variables first.\n  * CSS variables are indicated by `—variableName: value;` where variable name takes the place of a property.\n  * You can then use the variable via var(—variableName) in place of a property. This allows for easy duplication of same values across your style sheet.\n\n37:08 - JavaScript\n* JavaScript is used to add *interaction* to a website\n* It makes your website dynamic\n\n**JavaScript the Language**\n* We have a base programming language that has nothing to do with HTML\n* It has things like:\n  * Variables - ways to store things\n  * Numbers + Math\n  * Data Containers - Objects and Arrays\n  * Functions - Code grouped together to achieve a certain purpose\n* It also has a \"Standard Lib\" which means JavaScript comes with built-in support for doing common things:\n  * Formatting time + money\n  * Alerting the user\n  * Logging a value to developer tools\n  * Capitalizing things\n  * Sorting lists of things\n  * Round or randomize numbers\n  * Fetch data\n  * Talk to a sever\n* Promises\n  * Logic and flow control\n\n**JavaScript the DOM**\n* When the HTML is loaded, it\'s parsed into something called the DOM (Document Object Model)\n* Events\n  * JavaScript is mostly event-driven - when something happens, do something else\n  * When you click something and want something else to happen\n  * There are lots of events\n    * mouse, touch, pointer\n    * Ready\n    * Forms\n      * Submit, change, keyboard, etc.\n* Can be used to fetch data\n  * `fetch()` - you\'ll often hear it called Ajax, or XMLHttpRequest\n* Can be used to make more HTML\n  * Whole set of APIs for creating elements\n* The DOM can be traversed\n\n## Links\n* [https://css-tricks.com/](https://css-tricks.com/)\n* [https://getbootstrap.com/](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n* [https://get.foundation/](https://get.foundation/)\n* [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Tony Hawk\'s Pro Skater 1 + 2](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-switch/)\n* Wes: [Mini Split Air Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mini+Split+AC)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott:\n  1: [Level Up Tuts Pro](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n  2: [Become a Level Up Tutorials Author](https://forms.gle/PDEpDAGZpNHBDVou5)\n* Wes:\n  1: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n  2: [Javascript Notes & Reference](https://wesbos.com/javascript)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '80cbd24943bd537744af13a13fd8f42d2424f7645124264f35ce78d4224e2b6b', 'how-to-build-a-website-the-show-for-beginners', '/shows/378 - beginners.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.075', '2023-10-27 15:58:00.895', 'TASTY'),

I recently took on a freelance gig that requires a custom admin dashboard, and I wasn\'t really sure how to design one of those. My solution was to look up a pre-made Bootstrap dashboard template that can be purchased for $50-$500, and just re-create it myself. I looked at their live demo and reconstructed a very similar dashboard myself, using the same UI library. The outcome is not a perfect copy, although it\'s very close, and I never looked at their code base, so there\'s probably many differences there. But still, I can understand why some people might be upset by my attempt to copy someone else\'s design. I\'m not reselling it as a theme, just using it my freelance project with one client. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n16:36 - How do you decide how specific a (React) component should be?\n\n22:03 - My question is about the `npm run eject` feature of React. Is there a place where I should be using this feature or can I keep on ignoring that it exists?	\n\n24:04 - My question is for Scott. In one of the episodes in the past, you mentioned that you use YouTube private videos on [leveluptutorials.com](http://leveluptutorials.com/) using some kind of authentication. If I am not mistaken, you use a different platform to host videos now. Was there any reason to stop using that technique?	\n\n31:13 - I\'m setting up a webinar. I\'m going to require an iLok drive to access the FTP site, so I head over to Ali Baba, and I\'m on Ali Baba to buy the things, and I should mention my main concern would be data miners. I mean they\'re just like cyber-crackheads, really. So, I would imagine that any latency issues could be compensated through a registrar handshake with the firmware, and I\'d love to see a combination of both flash and HTML5, so my question is, would the eCommerce piece embed on the host platform, as well as the dialogue field for user names? Or, would the gateway socket extension be full duplex, as well as the packet switchover?	\n\n33:33 - How do you allow users to edit text to their profile or to messages they send to other users, without sacrificing the safety and security of your site?\n\n38:07 - Any tips on how should I use npm packages in Netlify functions? I read that I could commit node_modules (which for me sounds absolutely barbaric) and I also read that I could install netlify-lambda package with an additional postinstall script in the package.json. What\'s your approach?\n\n41:07 - Can you disable local fonts from the OS and check if the site actually loads them? \n\n46:02 - I have a question related to freelancing. Yesterday I took on a new client project. Price is locked in and contract is signed. Thing is, I am new to web dev freelancing and I now realise I have totally miscalculated the complexity and size of this project. What I initially estimated I could do in 3-4 weeks suddenly looks more like 6-8 weeks of work for me. Do I break the bad news for the client and ask to extend the deadline, outsource part of the work (which might lead to more hassle), or just buckle up and prepare to pull several all nighters to get on top of it? What would you do?\n\n49:09 - Question to Scott: Have you ever thought of calling your students Scott\'s Tots?	\n\n## Links\n* [https://mux.com/](https://mux.com/)\n* [https://vimeo.com/](https://vimeo.com/)\n* [https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)\n* [https://wesbos.com/sanitize-html-es6-template-strings](https://wesbos.com/sanitize-html-es6-template-strings)\n* [https://svelte.dev/](https://svelte.dev/)\n* [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)\n* [https://begin.com/](https://begin.com/)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_Tots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_Tots)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [I Think You Should Leave Season 2](https://www.netflix.com/title/80986854)\n* Wes: [Underground Wire Locator](https://amzn.to/2Vutc8J) \n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott:\n  1: [Level Up Tuts Pro](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n  2: [Become a Level Up Tutorials Author](https://forms.gle/47fnupLTnpatKXiH6)\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '51896f6c3961e329628ade64f7d0db23aa95715517f5718cf7875452d0538bcb', 'potluck-moist-code-memoization-ready-for-full-time-deadlines-design-ethics-react-components-video-hosting-local-fonts-more', '/shows/380 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.154', '2023-10-27 15:58:01.034', 'TASTY'),

Can be mad when you run out of time or budget.\n* Ill Communicator\n  * Contacts you at odd times.\n  * Thinks that you should answer every email in an hour.\n  * Contacts you in inappropriate ways, via text message, social media. OR doesn\'t respond to emails in a timely manner giving you blockers.\n* Jerk\n  * The rude client\n  * Thinks they can be rude because they are giving you money\n  * Hundreds of emails\n* Tries to be flashy upfront (dinners, etc.)\n  * Scatterbrain or way too big.\n  * Facebook for nurses\n\n18:06 - What to do about toxic clients\n* Communicate your needs clearly. Set expectations.\n  * \"I work best when...\"\n  * \"I answer emails once every two days\"\n  * Set clear deadlines for deliverables, feedback and revisions (one revision backed in, more at x hourly rate, etc.).\n  * Just be VERY clear. If something doesn\'t work for them, they will hopefully tell you.\n* Get things in writing.\n  * Put things clearly in a working agreement for your client to approve. That way you have something to show in case things go south and you can say, \"You agreed to the following things\".\n* Fire them\n  * You can fire clients. Honestly, some of them just aren\'t worth the time and effort. It\'s usually the cheapest clients who demand the most from you. Don\'t let them take more of your time and energy than they are paying for.\n  * Firing clients is very simple.\n    * Hi so and so, I don\'t feel like we\'re a good match for this project, so I\'ll be canceling our work agreement. Good luck on your project.\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '4d28a4c52f1966e5f49e008ceb4d0656424f11ade337bcc01ece7b5aa1bdb221', 'hasty-treat-freelance-tips-toxic-clients', '/shows/383 - toxic clients.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.367', '2023-10-27 15:58:01.212', 'HASTY'),

When appropriate and possible, a corresponding flag will be added to disable that behavior.\n\n03:26 - `noImplicitAny`\n* The `any` type in TypeScript is exactly that - it can be anything.\n* TypeScript will try to `infer` the type. When it can\'t it will be `any`.\n* Sometimes you need `any`, but if that is the case, you must explicitly type it as `any`.\n* If something is implicitly `any` - it might be a mistake, or you forgot to type it. Risky!\n\n06:01 - `noImplicitThis`\n* You must type `this` - it can\'t be implicitly inferred.\n\n06:47 - `strictFunctionTypes`\n* If you have a type that is a function and it doesn\'t 100%.\n\n07:44 - `alwaysStrict`\n* Always turns on strict mode. You can\'t do things like redeclare `var` variables.\n\n09:25 - `strictNullChecks`\n* Makes you check that the item is actually there before accessing a value or method from it.\n* Imagine you filter or find on an array, or query selector a DOM element. There is a possibility that nothing is there. `strictNullChecks` makes you check that it\'s there - like an if statement.\n* Optional chaining is super handy here.\n\n11:18 - `strictBindCallApply`\n\n12:38 - `strictPropertyInitialization`\n\n13:37 - `useUnknownInCatchVariables`\n\n## Links\n* [https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) \n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'e86b2bc7a6b3ca21782ad8bfb0e0dbc11155d6ea4b7e8b9b402d23ba508eb3e4', 'hasty-treat-typescripts-strict-explained', '/shows/385 - typescript.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.458', '2023-10-27 15:58:01.319', 'HASTY'),

[https://a0.to/syntax](https://a0.to/syntax)\n\n## Show Notes\n02:35 - What are the use cases of SASS/SCSS in 2021? Would you still choose it over CSS (or something else?) in a new project?\n\n05:26 - What ever happened to CSS Houdini?\n\n08:49 - With all these JS being transferred, have you ever tried to challenge yourself to build a project that doesn\'t involve any JS (in the front end alone); (e.g. just HTML+CSS)? I find it funny how I can pretty much use amazon.com with JS disabled, but I literally cannot view the angular docs if I disable it.\n\n11:40 - As we all know, Tim Berners-Lee made the web. Apparently, after seeing everyone’s data getting harvested by tech companies, he decided to make a project called Solid ([https://solidproject.org/](https://solidproject.org/)) that allows people to own their data and control all permissions to it. So if a user logs into your app with Solid, rather than storing their info on your server, you’d store it in *their* Solid Pod. Do you think this could save both Web developers’ conscience and disk space in the cloud?	\n\n15:47 - I am about to start my first developer job. What practices can I start to really get off on the right foot and lay down a foundation for a successful career?\n\n18:57 - Have you guys ever used your dev skills to trade for other goods or services? For instance, helping out an auto mechanic with their website in exchange for brake service on your car or creating a site for a barbershop traded for free haircuts for a year. If so, how do you go about starting that conversation?\n\n22:14 - What\'s your take on DRM? Have you implemented/integrated something like Widevine in any of your platforms/projects? How does one go about doing such a thing? I can\'t seem to find any good docs on that. I personally can relate as to why it\'s there, but end up hating it anyways. I recently found out that Prime Video only allows SD(sub HD) content on Linux and it had something to do with the Widevine DRM they employ. I got outraged and eventually canceled my subscription!\n\n29:35 - Have you seen the Framework laptop and, if so, what are your thoughts for web development? I’m a lifelong Mac user but the idea of a higher repairable laptop running Linux (I personally can’t do Windows) sounds like an amazing step forward for consumers.\n\n32:53 - I know that you both like MongoDB and so do I. But sometimes all these queries to database, especially aggregations gets messy, aren\'t they? Prisma has now support for MongoDB. What do you think? Is it a tool that will make requesting MongoDB much easier?\n\n37:02 - Hey guys, been diving into Svelte a bit recently and had a question about using it with GraphQL. As I recall Scott once deemed React Typescript GraphQL CodeGen \"the promised land\" and since then I tried it out and have found it awesome. However, I\'ve been debating moving a larger personal project from React to Svelte. I see that there is plugin for graphql-codegen-svelte-apollo but with my limited knowledge of Svelte find it hard to decipher if the development experience would be as streamlined. I am wondering if you could shed some light on the developer experience of working with GraphQL in Svelte in Typescript.\n\n40:58 - Do y’all have any thoughts about Frontity for WordPress? I swear I’m not a plant for Frontity, but I stumbled upon it today and I’m trying to evaluate it vs. other solutions like Next.js for use in a headless WordPress setup. Would love your thoughts if you have any!	\n\n43:40 - Call me weird, but I kind of like fiddling around with webpack configs. I just like the level of control I have here. That being said, is webpack going to die now that the \"better\" tools out there mature? Or do you think we might see a webpack v6 with esbuild under the hood that makes it compete with Parcel, Vite, Snowpack in terms of speed?\n\n## Links\n* [https://sass-lang.com/](https://sass-lang.com/)\n* [https://postcss.org/](https://postcss.org/)\n* [https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/)\n* [https://astro.build/](https://astro.build/)\n* [https://kit.svelte.dev/](https://kit.svelte.dev/)\n* [https://www.widevine.com/](https://www.widevine.com/)\n* [https://frame.work/](https://frame.work/)\n* [https://www.prisma.io/](https://www.prisma.io/)\n* [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)\n* [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n* [https://mongoosejs.com/](https://mongoosejs.com/)\n* [https://keystonejs.com/](https://keystonejs.com/)\n* [https://frontity.org/](https://frontity.org/)\n* [https://webpack.js.org/](https://webpack.js.org/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Hot App](https://github.com/macmade/Hot)\n* Wes: [Pet Food Mat](https://amzn.to/3ljDQdr)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Web Components Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'd744424106abe82ffcac1d6b8c219df715d78c0fd73531e2921ca509fa84017e', 'potluck-sass-houdini-no-js-solid-project-first-dev-job-tips-bartering-drm-dev-laptops-databases-frontity-more', '/shows/386 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.493', '2023-10-27 15:58:01.368', 'TASTY'),

It will tell you if that request was legit or not. \n* On the sending end, you can often set up headers with auth - same with the method\n* Can be a replacement for a serverless function\n\n13:18 - Testing webhooks\n* Can be a pain in the ass\n* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - expose locally\n* [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/)\n* [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)\n* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)\n* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) has a great VS code extension\n* [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com/) has an awesome dashboard\n  * Will also tell you when one failed\n* [webhook.site](http://webhook.site) \n* [https://expose.dev/](https://expose.dev/)\n* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)\n* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '6c1c0a3a0f99c6dc4493ac2261530b23d4ffbd6aadffd855d4daae0f986325d1', 'hasty-treat-webhooks', '/shows/389 - webhooks.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.619', '2023-10-27 15:58:01.542', 'HASTY'),

When you get a new Apple device like an iPhone, Apple Watch, or Macbook Pro... do you keep the box? Why or why not?\n\n06:56 - Hey guys! Awesome podcast! Could you go over the advantages and disadvantages of using local images vs external images service (e.g. Cloudinary) for displaying images on a web app?\n\n11:26 - Heyyyy Scott and Wes! 40-year-old lady here looking to make a career change. It\'s taken me a year plus, but after building several tutorial React apps, I finally built a fullstack JavaScript app of my own, with lots of rad Postgres database stuff, a bunch of secure Node/Express API endpoints, role-based access control, fancy Oauth, and of course the latest React tech (context, hooks, etc). I\'m pretty proud of it. I even managed to configure Nginx and deploy it to AWS. The only problem is...it looks like crap. My portfolio site itself is pretty darn slick, since I used a gorgeous Gatsby template that required only a bit of tweaking. But the site I architected and worked so hard to bring to life? It looks like an 8-bit game for toddlers, a responsive yet Bootstrapy game. My question: does this matter? I would hope that this project shows off my backend skills, but I\'m afraid they\'ll judge a book by its cover. (I guess a second question would be: how *do* you show off your backend skills? I have a README in my repo, but will they actually read it? Or, can you be a fullstack React developer with no design skills?) I am very, VERY ready to apply to jobs (emotionally and financially), but I am terrified of making a fool of myself and worried I\'ll never get hired. I am completely self-taught and have just been plugging away at this on my own for the duration of the pandemic, so I send a massive thank you to you guys for the sense of community that your show provides! Props to Wyze sprinkler controllers!\n\n16:14 - Scott, I just finished your \"SvelteKit\" course and now I\'m working on \"Building Svelte Components\". I have some questions regarding testing. I was listening to an interview with Rich Harris on Svelte Radio and it\'s my understanding that the framework is trying not to be opinionated as far as testing. What are you doing as far as testing with SvelteKit? Do you have any recommended packages/plugins/libraries? I\'ve only ever written unit tests with Jest in Vue. I\'m loving Svelte, but I really want to work on writing tests as well. Basically, everything/anything you\'ve got on testing with SvelteKit would be much appreciated. I\'ve been listening to the show since forever, you guys are both awesome, shout out to Wes too, you\'ve both taught me so much! Thank you, peace, love, and happiness <3\n\n20:25 - Hi Wes and Scott, I am weak when it comes to dev ops. I would like to confidently set up and deploy my applications on AWS and manage dev/prod environments. Any course recommendations to learn how to do this and how it all works so I really understand? If you don\'t personally, can you tweet this out so other developers can share their thoughts?\n\n22:30 - You both have praised MDX in the past but why would you use it? I understand that it lets you put JSX in your Markdown, but that seems counter to the purpose of using Markdown files for content. Markdown is a portable format for static content and independent of any front-end framework. That makes it a good choice for writing posts and rendering them in any site. Once you inject a React component into it, doesn\'t that eliminate the portability and the static nature of Markdown? At that point, why not just have a dynamic website where you have complete control of how content is rendered? What are your thoughts?\n\n27:14 - Hey Scott and Wes! I, like you both, am a developer with young kids (I have 3 boys age 6 and under). Needless to say, my house has a lot of energy in it. My job is quite flexible, which I appreciate, because it gives me some freedom to structure my day in a way that helps out my family. My question for you both is this: as a web developer with a spouse and young kids working from home, how do you both maintain a healthy work-life balance (avoid working too much, find time for yourselves, family time, etc.) Thanks so much!\n\n33:46 - Should I write a portfolio site using just the three fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS) or should I write them in something I am comfortable with such as Angular/React? Unsure if using a framework for a portfolio site is a good idea.	\n\n36:38 - How do you handle hosting when using WordPress as a headless CMS with something like Gatsby? WordPress needs good PHP hosting, while Gatsby needs good CI integration.\n\n38:52 - How frequently do you use `div` tags, versus trying to find a ‘better’ tag? Love the pod btw.\n\n40:48 - This is less of a question and more of a heads up for other listeners. Beware of scam job opportunities. I recently encountered a scam where they used a website that seemed like a very normal and reasonable job board for a major company. I went through the whole process until they asked for personal info, and I asked for verification of their person. They couldn\'t provide it so I left. But they had profiles matching the actual employees at the company. They had emails. They had an HR department and employees. They had a very legitimate operation going on. Make sure to take a second and verify with the company before giving away personal information or depositing any of their money into your account.\n\n47:38 - What percentage of North Americans keep their mobile device longer than three years? Five years? Eight years? I am a freelancer and I want to put a clause in my contract of what age of device my app will support, but I can\'t seem to find this information. Just more general answers like \"most people expect a phone to last two-three years.\"	\n\n## Links\n* [https://kit.svelte.dev/](https://kit.svelte.dev/)\n* [https://www.cypress.io/](https://www.cypress.io/)\n* [https://www.svelteradio.com/](https://www.svelteradio.com/)\n* [https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/)\n* [https://caddyserver.com/](https://caddyserver.com/)\n* [https://daringfireball.net/](https://daringfireball.net/)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [LuLaRich](https://www.amazon.com/LuLaRich-Season-1/dp/B09CFXPNSX)\n* Wes: [Flame Bulb](https://amzn.to/3zq74e2)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Web Components For Beginners](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Beginner JavaScript Course](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '52f7bfc6877fa3cd8f09c9f4277cc1b5c02e86ce19700ddf9422b78020f70169', 'potluck-corn-shucking-self-hosting-images-wordpress-getting-scammed-portfolios', '/shows/394 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:33.848', '2023-10-27 15:58:01.814', 'TASTY'),

I have a 5-year-old niece in kindergarten who is absolutely fascinated watching me work, and I\'d like to start teaching her basic concepts when she\'s able to read/write better. For example, she loves watching me make UI changes in React, it blows her mind that changing letters on one screen changes what a website looks like.\n\n11:01 - Kenny: Gentlemen! Love this show and the content you put out. It keeps me occupied during my 5 and 6 mile runs.  Thank you both for working so hard to keep it active, I know it takes a lot of work. I\'m curious what you think about hosting your own MongoDB server? I\'m relatively new to Mongo but want to start working with it for smaller projects. I\'ve used MySQL for a decade, hosted online with shared hosting. Worked well for my relational db needs. Should I host my own Mongo when I\'m ready for production, or pay the reasonable costs for something like Linode or maybe even Atlas? I have experience in Linux (enough to get by) and have my own virtualization cluster that I can spin up a server in seconds, along with an enterprise level firewall for managing traffic to and from. I actually just spun up a docker server this week and have a Mongo container running on it, though it\'s not accessible outside my network. This is purely for my development environments. Despite the firewall, my concern is security. Is it worth paying for a trusted solution like Linode, or should I put a little time in locking down my own Mongo container for my own use? Thank you both! Keep up the great work.\n\n14:42 - Mike: Not a question but more of a rant... It\'s 2021, almost 2022, can we all stop using \'foo\' and \'bar\' and \'baz\' when teaching a programming concept? I applaud both of you because I don\'t recall seeing any of your content ever using such atrocious terms, however, I\'m sad to see other prominent educators in the web development community use these terms from time to time. I feel like there are so many better examples that we could use to explain a concept and the use of \'foo\' is just confusing to beginners. That\'s all, just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for a wonderful podcast! #nomorefoo\n\n18:53 - Amir: Hey Wes and Scott, thank you for your awesome podcast. What are the best cities in Canada and USA to get (more quantity, highest-paying) developer jobs?	\n\n23:44 - LW: Hi guys, I am finally starting to get into GraphQL and I don\'t get it. Specifically I am working to convert an existing REST API to GraphQL. This seems really tough and there is not much guidance out there on how to do it. The main part I am unsure of is how to write resolvers. If I use the existing query then GraphQL just seems like an over-engineered filter method. If I write an individual resolver for each column in the table - that\'s gonna be 100s of resolvers and super annoying to write. Have either of you ever moved something from REST to GraphQL? And, if so, how did you handle this?\n\n27:57 - Dan: How does someone learn and actually practice using these system design topics like load balancing, caching, and database sharding. I have never had the need to use some of these things in my day-to-day work, but recently been interviewing and in the system design portion of the interview I feel a little lost. I\'ve read about these topics and watched videos but haven\'t really seen how to implement these things. Any good resource recommendations?\n\n31:57 - Matt: How do you know if you can trust an NPM package, from an unknown developer, that does not have many GitHub stars and has relatively few downloads? (The repo that made me ask this question is [https://github.com/Wondermarin/react-color-palette](https://github.com/Wondermarin/react-color-palette)). NPM audit automatically runs when you install a package, do any of you ever use additional security checks?\n\n38:32 - Yosef: Hi I\'m a beginner front-end developer and I heard you saying that being able to copy prototypes is a valuable skill, so I found some Figma free template and I copied them, the question is can I put them in my portfolio or deploy them?\n\n40:00 - Nick: Hey dudes! I picked up a freelance project to make a brochure-style website and found myself having trouble to decide on what tools to pick for this site. I wanted to ask you and get your take, what tools/tech would you use to build a brochure site? By this, I mean the site should have mainly company information that is ideally editable by the stakeholders and has a contact form. Thanks!\n\n44:22 - Casey: Hi Scooter and Wild Wes! Why do I feel so dirty when I\'m forced to use negative values in CSS?\n\n45:45 - Gnommer: Do you use some cloud sync service to backup your directory with projects? I mean OneDrive, Dropbox etc. \nI tried to use it alongside with Git, and it just messed my files so badly. On the other side I feel very uncomfortable without any backup apart from Github. BTW, according to last Potluck: polish \'ł/Ł\' is pronounced like \'w\' in \'what a sick podcast you have\'.

I wanted to share with you something that happened just the other day (Oct 4th), I was starting my new job today at a large tech company. They use React for everything (even DNS!, don\'t ask me how, it\'s complicated). I figured I\'d celebrate my first day and push some code to prod, (how hard could useEffect be right?) Next thing you know, they ended up bringing in a guy with an angle grinder to get access to the server cage.\n\n04:15 - No one from Denver can buy\n\n06:38 - Bug accidentally gives $90 million to users\n* https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/defi-protocol-compound-mistakenly-gives-away-millions-to-users.html\n\n08:34 - Share Pointy Knives\n* Hi! I\'m a developer at a consulting firm in Sweden, writing C# on the backend and using React with either JavaScript or TypeScript and hosting things in Azure 99% of the time (and 1% in SharePoint). I was in my last week at my last job before I was due to start my new job. Worked 12 h/day to keep up with all the handovers etc. to colleagues so they would have a chance to continue working on the solutions I have taken care of. One project was a process tool hosted in SharePoint Online. The guy who would oversee it had -1% experience with SharePoint (which I pointed out to my bosses). But to make things a bit easier, I wrote a deploy script to ease things a bit. Starts the terminal and runs the script towards the acceptance environment. Umpteen million errors appear... Which is strange, because there would only be about 20 commands (which can cause errors like these). I log into the environment to double check if I now accidentally entered the wrong values in the script (which looked okay according to me). But I get a 404 error when I try to reach the environment... I log into the admin interface; I discover that the site is gone... Also checking the trash can, there are no things there. Very strange. I find that I\'m in a different folder than the one where I saved my script... In that folder there is an old deploy script that was used when the project was started a thousand years ago (which was not used after the project was \"finished\"). The first thing the script does is force delete the site and then try to create a new empty site... The site is gone with lists and everything (lists are a SharePoint thing, think of it as sql-lite), there are no backups of the acceptance environment (although it is very important). I just feel a little panicked about how I\'m going to solve this. However, I remember testing a tool six months ago to copy entire environments. Where the first attempt was made on the acceptance environment. Finds the cloned environment and can use the same tool to clone it back. It took only 8-12 hours of work to create all the new things done in the environment in the last 6 months instead of X number of hours to build everything from scratch.\n* Once I updated a feature that saves accessories on orders (same solution). However, I failed to add all the new fields to the production environment. Which meant that accessories were not saved at all... Which was discovered after a week... I fixed the error in 5 minutes and the sellers had to contact x number of customers to double check what kind of accessories they would have for their orders...\n\n11:22 - External HD\n* One time I needed to format a server. It was an outdated Windows server. I selected all the files and copied and pasted to an external hard drive. My drive was pretty fast and it took like a minute. I was like: “Wow! That’s a great external hd”. Formatted the server and, as soon as I realized it didn’t copy 10% of the files, I had that face. We all know that face. Anyways. Tried to restore the files using some HD recovery tools but they were all corrupted, not by the formatting itself but for the installation of the new OS. My boss was pissed! I was very young so I blame it on the server. I’m not proud of it. But why the heck they would ask a developer to format a server in the first place? By the way, my birthday is on Halloween. Spoooky.\n\n13:07 - Hey Loser\n* I was testing new code to automate mass-mailings to our customers. Who knows what demon drove me but I wrote the “test” mailings like ransom notes: “Dear loser! Fork over all your $$$ or else!” Well, all was looking great and I wa s feeling pretty pleased with myself. Progress bars were sliding and counters were spinning. But I could hear a rising commotion from the marketing guys behind me. Phones ringing, voices raised. Turns out I had moronically wired myself to the production database! Even worse for me, I’d only been at the company a month or two. I thought my goose was cooked and the Big Boss was plenty mad, but I owned up right away and apologized. We put out a cover story that we’d been hacked and all was forgiven.\n\n15:01 - HE HATE ME\n* I was part of the developer team that accidentally leaked the 8 cities the XFL, an alternate football league, a week before their press conference. [ewrestling.com/article/wwe-ac…](http://ewrestling.com/article/wwe-ac%E2%80%A6) We were using Contentful and Gatsby. A junior dev entered the information into the prod space instead of the UAT space and when we released some bug fixes, it picked up the contact us content update. I found out after seeing stories pop up in Google News when I was about to go to sleep. Was taking the content down when we started getting calls from the CIO of the WWE. The league went bust because of COVID.\n\n19:23 - I Don\'t Have Memory of This\n* I had two pretty bad code changes that only showed their problems when they went live in production. Around 6 years ago, I was running into a large performance issue with some of our queries running slowly against this giant DB. We were using JPA/Hibernate and we had a bunch of joins that were done lazily. I switched a few of them to eager so that they would create a single SQL statement instead of a bunch (or thousands). The change worked fine on my dev environment, QA, and staging. Staging was supposed to be representative of production. So we went live and within minutes the entire system went down because of out of memory errors. We quickly switched back to the lazy joins. We found out that staging had more memory and fewer DB records than production though they were supposed to be exactly the same.\n\n21:05 - Your Performance is Slowing us down\n* Back when VMWare was becoming a thing, like 2010 or so. I was working at an ecomm site and we were seeing slow performance between the app server and some data services. I decided to build a little multithreaded logger that could track when a query to Oracle Financials was running too slow and generate a warning. Oracle Financials was doing the credit card transactions, orders, and all the rest of the sites DB work. The code had no impact on my dev, QA, and staging environments. We were hitting well over our minimum number of concurrent users. We deployed it to production and then the system got slower and slower, but never crashed. Again, production and staging were set up differently. Staging was a bare-metal server. Production was running on an ESXi server on a host that was split 4 ways. The multi-threaded code meant to detect performance degradations was slowing the whole system down when it tried to synchronize data across threads. I was pretty embarrassed by both these two issues. It went to show that production is its own special thing and that you really don\'t know if your server-side code is really going to work until it starts running there.\n\n23:15 - Dead Button\n* Way back when mainframes were king, a guy I worked with pushed a button in, that if released, would immediately take down the entire company. He stood there for 4 hours, holding the button in, until we could let it crash after business hours. We gave him a chair after 2 hours.\n\n25:12 - No Deploys on Fridays\n* I was a junior dev working on our company\'s website. They were HTML + nunjucks templates that were later being integrated with the backend using some Python witchcraft. There was also a metric ton of JS libraries added (like Babra for page transitions, threejs for a cool interactive animation on the landing page etc.). Didn\'t really get much of all this package.json stuff at that seniority level. So after running yarn or npm or whatever, and seeing some warnings about a couple packages being outdated, I decided to update some of them. It ran great locally, but I didn\'t build the prod version, as I didn\'t know there could be any differences. I was working on some minor feature (or maybe even some minor bug) and the PM decided there\'s no time for code review. So I pushed it to the repo, the backend guy did his integration, and launched it on prod. As it turned out, there were some breaking changes in one of the libraries I decided to update. It crashed the entire site. On Friday. At 4:30PM. And that, kids, is why you don\'t deploy on Fridays.\n\n27:33 - Stupid Selfie\n* Horror story for you Wes. I work for one of the biggest retailers in the UK and we were working on an app that would go on a \'media wall\' in their flagship store in London. Basically a giant 200-inch screen in the middle of the store that social content can go on. Turns out that I left my local Dev version connected to the production API when I uploaded a couple of stupid selfies of my big head in the office. Get a call the next day to ask why my face is on the medial wall.\n\n28:37 - Soda\n* I was a computer operator back in the late 1960’s, operating a Honeywell mainframe. The consoles were huge, about the size of a dishwashing machine, with the console typewriter and printer inset in the middle, on top. I had a soft drink on the console, next to the typewriter mechanism. We were told never to bring a drink into the room but we all did it, especially on third shift. Long story short, someone called my name, I turned around and knocked the glass of soda into the console. Had to be completely replaced – machine was down for two days. My boss was not happy.\n\n31:22 - Oof\n* A bigger horror story. I had my own software company in the 90’s and was in Singapore, customizing my software package for Johnson & Higgins Insurance Brokers – I had their Asian contract for my Insurance Broker/Accounting package. I spent a good 40 hours on Saturday and Sunday, making all the changes they asked for, getting ready for a demo on Monday morning. I finished up about 4am on Monday morning and was cleaning up my files. All this work was done on a Novell server. Print files had an extension of .prt and I had a ton of them in the main directory from all of the testing I had done. I was cleaning out old files, getting ready to back everything up and I thought I would delete all of the print files. I mistakenly keyed in erase *.prg, instead of erase *.prt (or whatever the delete command was – can’t remember it now). Programming files have a .prg extension – I had deleted all of my updated files from the weekend. In desperation I called Novell in Utah, hoping they could help me recover the files, but no-go. The demo Monday morning was not fun.\n\n33:24 - Young Dev\n* I was a young dev right out of college. My first job was at a child support company where we had desktop apps that would handle case information more efficiently than using Excel. My first project was to write a POC that would later be implemented into a new, bigger app that consolidated all the “POCs” for various parts of the child support process. For some odd reason, I still don’t know why to this day, my boss wanted me to write this “new” app on top of an old app with a bunch of legacy code. I never understood why but as a young dev fresh out of school, you tend to just do what you’re told. In school, I mainly used PHP/HTML/CSS for learning how to work with a database; this job however used C#/.NET for their desktop apps so I was doing a lot of learning as I went. I remember finally learning how to connect to the database and run some SQL after fighting with this old pile of legacy code. In early versions, I chose to handle creates/updates for these records in the same function. My young, dumb self wrote a try catch statement that would attempt to create the record and if it failed, it would try to update the record. Before the first production release, I updated the flow to handle creates/updates in separate functions - but never removed the update in the catch block of the original function now used for creates only. Somehow I, or any PM/QA, never failed on a create and hit this catch block while testing. Fast-forward probably 9-12 months later, I got a ticket to investigate why every case’s data looked the same in Production. I login to the app, search a few case numbers and sure enough, every case’s data is the same. I began freaking out as I had no clue how this could’ve happened. I mean it had never happened in all the dev work, testing, and months of live Production use. After I investigated with a senior dev, we realized the try block had failed and the update query in the catch block ran for that record - we also realized that I left off the where clause in the related SQL query to specify which record needs updating - so ALL records got updated with this data. Thankfully, we kept regular back-ups and were able to restore the data to a recent timeframe without users losing a ton of work. We commented out that database update call and redeployed the code ASAP. Also the senior dev was cool about it and was like “hey, it happens to all of us at some point”. Let’s just say I’ve learned a ton since then and definitely steer clear from writing code like that. You live and you learn I suppose.\n\n38:40 - Where Wolf\n* Here’s my development tale of terror: One night I was burning the midnight oil trying to get caught up on a never-ending workload. At the time I was working for an online travel booking site. It was after 11, and the last thing I had to do for the night was to rename one of the hotels in our production database. So I wrote my query: `UPDATE hotels SET name=‘Some Hotel Chain’;` One problem, I FORGOT THE WHERE CLAUSE. Suddenly, over 5,000 hotels in our production database all had the same name. This was around 2003, so well before the time of point-in-time restores, and we were only backing up the database every week at that point. I was panicking. Fortunately, I had a dump of the production database that I had created only a couple of hours earlier sitting on my local hard drive. So thankfully, I was able to restore almost all of the hotel names, save for a couple that signed up after that data dump, and my boss was none the wiser. That’s when I learned that working late hours is not worth it, because at some point you are so tired that you can no longer make good decisions.\n\n41:19 - I Want Your Job\n* When I first started out I worked for a consultancy and they trained us in sales meetings to help managers get promoted because we were coming in to make them \"look good\". This was okay b/c obviously, we were coming in as a contractor; however, after being laid off due to 9/11 (yes, this was about 20 years ago), I was looking for a new job and during an interview when asked where I\'d like to be in X years, I mentioned to the hiring manager that I wanted to eventually do what he was doing. Well, I guess he didn\'t take it that I wanted to make him get promoted to then take his spot. Safe to say I didn\'t get hired. 🤦‍♂️😜\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [Portable Air Compressor](https://amzn.to/3atw3mP)\n* Wes: [ESR Magnet Phone Mount](https://amzn.to/3mJyLKB)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Latest courses on Prisma and Astro](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', '59fb8fbf54b3d03e22b990d5d9558a0f87622142a84a9f312af28cc270778791', 'horror-web-dev-stories-2021', '/shows/400 - horror stories.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:34.104', '2023-10-27 15:58:02.144', 'TASTY'),

I’d like to know if you use eyeglasses and if you have any preference regarding models, design and features like blue-light blocking and anti-reflection. Also, where do you buy them? Do you go to a store to try them out, or do you buy them online? And if ordering online, which specifications do you use besides the doctor’s prescription? If you guys have any sick picks about eyeglasses it would be great to hear it too. Thanks for the show and have a great week!!!\n\n11:04 - Hi, I would like to know how the two of you deal with stress? I am a freelancer and sometimes clients can get the worst in me. When they do, I usually take a long walk and listen to a podcast, but I don\'t always have the time for that. I can actually go into my commit history and show which one was under stress.

I know a lot of people who have no idea what this word means.

Have either of you read the book? Anyways, why do devs say this?\n\n24:50 - Steve Lewis: If you guys were not self-employed, would you prefer to work for a big company (like FAANG) or go to a smaller agency or startup, etc.?\n\n27:08 - So Many Localhost Errors: This may be a softball, but how do you set up your logging (Sentry and/or LogRocket) so your dev environment isn\'t firing all the time? I can\'t seem to find a way to do this well (and it\'s probably because I\'m trying to learn as I go). \n\n31:03 - Josh J from Jersey: Hey guys, loving the podcast, I\'ve been listening for about a month but bingeing through your episodes during my mind-numbing warehouse job, helps me keep my mind on JavaScript and what I have managed to learn in my spare time. I was wondering, when you\'re sitting down to a new project, how do you design the website? Does it just slowly develop as you code or have you sat down and drawn out what you want it to look like ahead of time? I have heard talk of a remarkable pad. I\'ve seen ads for this on Instagram and YouTube but always assumed it was a very gimmicky thing. Is this a good investment? Also wondering how you both met? Have you worked on any projects together outside of courses and Syntax? Keep the content coming!\n\n38:14 - Andras: Hi Wes and Scott. You have talked a lot on the show about headless CMS\'s like Sanity, Prismic or even WordPress being used as a headless CMS. I am curious what the setup in a real world project is like. How would you host the CMS? And what will the admin surface look like? Will the button styles, background color etc. be different than the actual website that the end user sees? Is that a problem for the admin users? Does the admin user see all the menu for creating new content types or adding new features? Or do they only see the input fields of all the contents that can be added to a specific page? Thank you!\n\n42:14 - Dave: Hey guys, love the podcast! I understand that CORS prevention is in place in the browser to help improve security/prevent malicious requests across domains, but I don\'t understand why you can get around this by performing the request server side, for example via cURL? If I were a malicious actor, surely I could just send my cross domain request through a proxy to avoid the CORS issue? I\'m sure I\'m missing something obvious here, can I please get your thoughts on this?\n\n44:48 - Lemon: How do you implement authentication with GraphQL? Especially in Fastify, I know Scott recently moved over from Meteor to Fastify, so I too was checking Fastify but couldn\'t find a satisfying auth solution that fits well with GraphQL.\n\n48:08 - Zack Vogel: I love when you play games on the podcast. I\'m a high school technology teacher and I play a game with my students called the 5 Second Rule. It\'s based on a board game, but I have changed the topics to technology-themed questions. The game works like this. One person reads a topic \"Name Three VS Code Extensions\" and the other person has five seconds to respond with three correct answers.\nI think this could be a fun game to play on the podcast. \n\n## Links\n* [http://www.seeeyewear.com/](http://www.seeeyewear.com/)\n* [https://www.warbyparker.com/](https://www.warbyparker.com/)\n* [https://www.costco.com/](https://www.costco.com/)\n* [MariaDB dynamic columns](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/dynamic-columns/)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok)\n* [https://twitter.com/argyleink](https://twitter.com/argyleink)\n* [https://remarkable.com/](https://remarkable.com/)\n* [https://figma.com/](https://figma.com/)\n* [https://graphql.org/](https://graphql.org/)\n* [https://www.meteor.com/](https://www.meteor.com/)\n* [https://www.fastify.io/](https://www.fastify.io/)\n* [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oRqz1rSUXiLc5pJF2cMygNrodcRrRU77x0KdWGV67Iw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oRqz1rSUXiLc5pJF2cMygNrodcRrRU77x0KdWGV67Iw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## ××× SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS ×××\n* Scott: [myQ Chamberlain Smart Garage Control](https://amzn.to/3mxqIl2) \n* Wes: [ATOTO Head Unit](https://amzn.to/31bh9zY)\n\n## Shameless Plugs\n* Scott: [Level Up Tutorials Pro](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/pro) - Sign up for the year and save 25%!\n* Wes: [All Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/) - Use the coupon code \'Syntax\' for $10 off!\n\n## Tweet us your tasty treats!\n* [Scott\'s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stolinski/)\n* [LevelUpTutorials Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LevelUpTutorials/)\n* [Wes\' Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wesbos/)\n* [Wes\' Twitter](https://twitter.com/wesbos)\n* [Wes\' Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wesbos.developer)\n* [Scott\'s Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolinski)\n* Make sure to include [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/SyntaxFM) in your tweets', 'fa812ee2ae7229a61cc60b45dac73718fcc699a789846904264ee4088a1c4064', 'potluck-copilot-glasses-databases-dealing-with-stress-employment-vs-self-employment-auth-in-graphql-headless-cms-more', '/shows/406 - potluck.md', '2023-10-16 20:07:34.347', '2023-10-27 15:58:02.549', 'TASTY'),
