		<p>
			Once a month we do <strong>Potluck</strong> episodes. That's a stupid name for a show where we
			answer you questions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Have a question about web development? It can literally be about anything!. Submit it in the
			form below and we will try and answer it on a future show! Feel free to ask anonymously if you
			prefer us not to mention your name.
