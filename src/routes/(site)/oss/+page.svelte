				<p><a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/">The Open Source Pledge</a> just launched.</p>

				<p>
					Sentry has pledged <strong>$750,000</strong> for this year, of which we get
					<strong>$50,000</strong> to distribute to open source projects!
				</p>

				<p>
					Is there a project you can't live without? A dependency <a
						target="_blank"
						href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">propping up the entire ecosystem</a
					>? A maintainer exploring new ground? <strong>Send us your suggestions!</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Include links to the projects and a brief explanation as to why you think project or
					maintainer deserves it.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will collect submissions until mid November, and announce them on an upcoming episode
					of Syntax.
				</p>

				<p>
					Do you work at a company that uses open source software? We would like to encourage you to
					join <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/">The Open Source Pledge</a>.
