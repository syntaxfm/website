3:08 - What is a frontend framework?

* JavaScript based
    * Controls applications such as:
    	* Routing
    	* Rendering
    	* Data Fetching
	* Examples:
    	* React
    	* Angular
    	* VueJS
    	* Ember
    	* Backbone
    	* Svelte

5:54 - When to use a frontend framework

* The Link between your JavaScript data and the DOM (your HTML) isn't live
* The use of frameworks makes re-updating the DOM (after the initial variable update) easy
* You need an opinionated way to handle complexity
    * Example:
    	* You add an item to a shopping cart, send the event to the backend, and update both the number of items in the cart and the "Add to cart" button
    	* Event Handlers - binding and un-binding
* Your client wants a fast, modern experience
* Seamless routing and page transitions
* Fast prototyping
* Access to battle-tested libraries
    * Security
    * Perf

14:24 - When not to use a frontend framework

* When using CMS like WordPress and Drupal
* A medium amount of JavaScript is needed - Vanilla JS will work fine
    * Modals
    * Slideshows
    * Form submits
* Static pages, no JS functionality
* Updating an existing project

17:20 - Why can't I just use jQuery?

* Vanilla JS contains all of jQuery's available DOM APIs 
* Frameworks provide structure
* Organizes code for big projects
