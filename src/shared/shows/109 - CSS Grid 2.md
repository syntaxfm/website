3:27 - CSS Grid Level 2 and subgrid

* CSS subgrid will allow you to place grid-items' children along the same lines at the parent grid

5:40 - How it works - Why do we need it? What problem do we have right now?

1. Create your grid as normal - you can create columns, rows, named lines, etc.
2. Your grid-item will also be display grid - this is nothing new - just regular nesting of grid
3. The magic comes in when you want to define the rows and or columns of the sub-item. You can inherit the parent item's grid-rows / columns by simply saying `display: subgrid`

11:19 - Browser support

* It's about a year out
