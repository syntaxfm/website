## Show Notes

2:11 - What is a headless CMS?

* It's a system or CMS that has no front-end (aka head)
* Allows you to use front-end specific tech (static generators/front-end frameworks) instead of the back-end to generate pages

4:37 - Some examples

* Can be used with any type of website that can consume an API
* WordPress API + Gatsby
* Hosted Service + React App 

7:06 - Why?

* Separation of concerns - your data is in a single spot, and can be pulled into any app, website, marketing micro site, etc. 
* Keeps ergonomics of WordPress or $CMSHERE, while developers get to use what they like
* Optimizes for performance with static builds
* Hide the implementation details and back-end from view

10:19 - Live vs statically-generated website

* [Syntax 120 - Gatsby vs Next](https://syntax.fm/show/120/gatsby-vs-next)

10:55 - How?

* Connects to API via normal fetch calls/GraphQL/whatever you use
* Needs to host your back-end either as a service or on a host
* Needs to host your front-end either on the same server as your back-end or on something specialized like Netlify
